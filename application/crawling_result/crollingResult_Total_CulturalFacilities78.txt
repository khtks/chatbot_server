The Chojun Textile & Quilt Museum in Namsan-dong, central Seoul, is the only museum in Korea that displays local and foreign textile art. 
<br><br>
The museum brings together a number of beautiful quilts and other textiles from around the world that embody the love and spirit of the women who created them. These works include Korean traditional personal ornaments, ceremonial dresses, everyday objects, and traditional costumes of the Chinese Miao tribe. The displays of rare foreign quilts and Korean traditional patchwork quilts dating back as far as 100 years have been attracting a continuous flow of quilt aficionados and international tourists.
<br><br>
As you may already know, the term ‘quilt’ refers to a coverlet made of two layers of fabric decoratively stitched together with a layer of cotton in between. A long time ago, Koreans wore quilted clothes and held quilting parties similar to the Western quilting bee. Koreans have long since used various cloth remnants to make quilts. 

<br><br>Though the actual type of cloth, pattern, and stitching may vary from country to country and person to person, quilts the worldover represent the resourcefulness and care of the people who made them. At the museum, visitors can compare the styles of a variety of beautiful Asian and Western textile works, which is perhaps one of the main draws of the museum.
<br><br>
The museum’s first exhibition presented the winning works of the Japan International Quilt Contest. It then hosted the first Korean Quilt Contest and presented the winning works of the contest at the museum. It has since held several shows featuring quilts and other textile works including “The Manhole Quilt Exhibition for a Beautiful Environment” and the World Traditional Textile Exhibition.
<br><br>
In addition to exhibits and various programs, the museum has served as an educational center for textile artists by organizing a number of workshops and seminars. Fast emerging as a favorite destination for foreign tourists thanks to its unique items and exhibitions, the Chojun Textile & Quilt Art Museum plans to hold more diverse exhibitions and contests in the future while continuing to exhibit its permanent collection of Korean textile art.<br><br>

The programs at the museum are aimed at providing the general public with opportunities to get closer to the textile arts, which remain unfamiliar to many, and to help preserve Korea’s textile traditions and promote them worldwide. In addition, by introducing unique textile artwork from overseas, the museum seeks to offer opportunities for local textile artists to obtain new ideas and techniques and gain a wider, global perspective.|24|+82-2-753-4074~5|Chojun Textile & Quilt Art Museum (초전섬유ㆍ퀼트박물관)|04631|A02|A02|A0206|A02060100|

Insa-dong is famous as a traditional cultural street. Kyung-In Museum of Fine Art is a cultural ground for artists and is also a tourist attraction. It is divided into three gallery halls, an outdoor gallery hall, an outdoor stage where many events take place, a screen, and finally a traditional teahouse.

The four halls in the museum give the feeling of all flowing together into one continual, unified space. The building pays homage to Lee’s life and works, dating from his early ventures to his final days.<br>

He created a large entrance and an extremely small exit. The small exit is video art. When we take the exit, we are out of the scope of influence of Marcel Duchamp.’ The NJP Art Center is a creative space, wherein it is possible to practice the ‘mediation of endless potential unfolded outside the exit of Duchamp’. As a space of ‘introspective anarchy of infinite light and life’, the NJP Art Center aims to become a venue for the ‘escape from enlightenment’, going beyond enlightenment. Paik Nam-june, who was well versed in aesthetics and music, rather than the figurative arts, discovered a new ‘exit’ by combining electronic music and happenings. He didn’t regard video and television, with their great disseminative power, or communication networks, as a means for communicating messages, but as an explosion of time, instead creating a space for mandala-based televisuals, and for participation by the public where ‘consilience’ among heterogeneous fields can take place. 
<br><br>
Inheriting the spiritual legacies of Paik Nam-june, the NJP Art Center will expand the possibilities of creating new media for information and communication in the information age, and create a new space for cultural participation from aesthetic, ethical, and political perspectives. The center aims at expanding effective, creative consumption by encouraging reflections on the aspects of human existence that are still involuntary and lack freedom. The center aspires to become a space for cultural mediation that expands the space of freedom’s activities throughout the globe.|23|No tel|NJP Art Center (백남준아트센터)|17068|A02|A02|A0206|A02060500|

Over 20,000 royal relics from Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Changgyeonggung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine are on display.   
<br>

<br>
<b>1. Royal Symbols and Records<br></b>
The Joseon Dynasty attained Confucian ideals, and therefore, the king and his queen were worshipped as parents of all citizens. To elevate their authority, the Joseon royal households crafted various royal symbols. 
<br>

<b>2. Ancestral Rites<br></b>
The royal ancestral rite was held at a royal shrine encompassing the ancestral tablets of the late kings and queens of the Joseon Dynasty. This was not merely a royal ancestral worshipping ceremony, but also a festival with music and dance, in the hope for the nation's eternal prosperity. 
<br>

<b>3. Palace Architecture  </b>
<br>
The palace was the living quarters of the king and his family as well as the center of administration where the king ruled the nation. The center of the palace in the Joseon Dynasty, according to traditional Oriental architectural planning, was featured at Jeongjeon. The main hall was the center of state events and political discussions, and the Pyeonjeon, the government office.
<br>

<b>4. Joseon Sciences<br></b>The Joseon Dynasty strove to establish the legitimacy of its foundation to enrich the nation's economy. To attain these ideals, the dynasty unprecedentedly promoted such areas as the sciences and medicine while developing various weapons for national defence.
<br>

<b>5. Royal Life<br></b>The king and queen were symbolic figures of the Joseon Dynasty, but they were also ordinary people who lived private lives within the palace. The palace was divided into various sections of living space such as the king's office, the queen's quarters, and the prince's study room. Each section contained appropriate pieces of furniture, which were made of the finest quality materials according to well-established criteria for the royal family.|23|No tel|National Palace Museum of Korea (국립고궁박물관)|03045|A02|A02|A0206|A02060100|

* What is ‘daldongne’?<br>
Literally meaning ‘moon village,’ it refers to villages located high on the hilltops, where residents can easily see the moon. The first, ‘Daldongne,’ originated back in the late 1950s, early 1960s when people ousted from the city for economic reasons began to live in tent areas designated by the government. These ‘Dalnara Cheonmakchon’ (moon tent villages) were typically located on the hillside where residents could see the moon and stars when lying in their beds at night. Although the word ‘Daldongne’ reminds many Koreans of trying times in the past, it also conjures up an image of a time when neighborhoods worked hard and shared what little they had with each other.<br><br>|5|+82-32-770-6131|Sudoguksan Museum of Housing and Living (수도국산달동네박물관)|22541|A02|A02|A0206|A02060100|

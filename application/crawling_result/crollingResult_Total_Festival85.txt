The ceremony, which is held in front of the Daehanmun Gate of Deoksugung Palace, is a tradition similar to the Changing of the Guards at Buckingham Palace and offers a rare opportunity to experience royal culture. The royal gate is opened and closed at pre-determined times, and the gatekeepers in charge of guard duty and patrols hold a shift ceremony three times a day.<br>
 <br>
The Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony is a highly recommended event for tourists. It is held three times a day in, with each ceremony following the same procedure and lasts for forty minutes to an hour, and the ceremony is free of charge. There are no ceremonies on Mondays as well as on severely cold or hot days.<br><br>
As the ceremony begins, the changing of the guards commences replete with traditional musical instruments, and exchanges a password for verification. An eight-minute guard ceremony ensues, followed by a seven-minute change ceremony, and finally a patrol that completes the ceremony. The procedure takes a dramatic turn when 18 guards in six official positions beat a drum and bellow some orders.<br>
 <br> The Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony is a great opportunity to experience a rare traditional scene. Be sure to bring a camera. The guards’ splendid costumes, with their brilliant primary colors, are a pleasure to view. While you cannot take pictures with the guards during the changing of guards, you can take a background picture of the guards and palace. You can also take photographs with the gatekeepers after the ceremony is over. Visit the palace and enjoy the beauty of Korean palaces following the ceremony.|24|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese)<br>• For more info: +82-2-120|Deoksugung Palace Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony (덕수궁 왕궁수문장교대의식)|04519|A02|A02|A0208|A02080100|

The ritual is held yearly on the first Sunday of May. It begins with <em>eogahaengnyeol</em>, the fabulous royal parade dating from the Joseon dynasy, which is truly a sight to behold as it moves through the modern city. <br><br>
Jongmyodaeje originated as a royal ancestral ritual to honor the past kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty. During the Joseon era, the ritual was held five times a year (spring, summer, autumn, winter, and December) until it was abolished by Japanese colonial rule. In 1969, Jongmyodaeje was reinstated and has been held in May every year since. <br><br>
Jongmyo Shrine, the destination of the procession, was the setting of ceremonial rituals during the Joseon dynasty. Originally, Jongmyo only referred to Jeongjeon (Main Hall) where the memorial tablets of Joseon’s reigning kings and queens are enshrined. Today, however, Jongmyo also encompasses Yeongnyeongjeon (Hall of Eternal Peace) where the tablets of posthumous kings and queens are enshrined and Gongsindang (Hall of Meritorious Subjects) where the tablets of esteemed ministers of the state are kept.|23|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330 <br>(Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-70-4280-1648|Jongmyodaeje (Royal Ancestral Memorial Rite of Joseon) (종묘대제)|03135|A02|A02|A0207|A02070200|

Based on thorough historical research and consultation by the palace’s counsel panel, the event is organized to commemorate the significance of Korean history and to shed some new light on a fading traditional culture.<br>
<br>
Garye in Korean refers to a royal wedding or enthronement of the king; or a wedding or formal installation of a crown prince or his eldest son, or the prince imperial or his son. Because it is a major national ceremony, it is not uncommon for thousands of people to be mobilized during several months just for this event. Also, because of the strict and complex procedures and formalities of Joseon Dynasty royal weddings, the procedures were established according to a set of regulations. In all traditional Korean weddings, the groom customarily visited the bride’s house and brings her to his home. The same applied to the king. However, because common houses were limited in space, royal weddings were held at Byeolgung, known as detached palaces. For King Gojong and Queen Min, Unhyeongung Palace was used as the Byeolgung. The reenactment of the wedding starts with Eoga Haengnyeol, a royal procession led by a banner emblazoned with the king’s coat of arms, the yellow dragon. Following the coat-of-arms banner was the five directions banner and other traditional royal trappings. Then followed the Bisuchaeg Uisik, or the formal installation of Min as the queen, and the Chinyeong, in which King Gojong takes her as the queen. The wedding reenactment lasts for two hours.<br>
<br>
This ceremony is an exact reenactment of the royal wedding ceremony of Joseon's imperial family. It offers a great opportunity to see royal costumes and the lifestyle of Joseon dynasty. The traditional royal costumes are spectacular and elegant, and the wedding displays such regal and grandeur distinction. After the ceremony, there is a photo session, so don’t forget to bring a camera.|23|• 1330 Travel Hotline: +82-2-1330<br> (Korean, English, Japanese, Chinese) <br> • For more info: +82-2-766-9090|King Gojong and Queen Min’s Royal Wedding Ceremony (고종명성후 가례 재현행사)|03131|A02|A02|A0208|A02081300|

 Unfortunately, Nanjido was used as a landfill site between 1978 and 1993 and the once beautiful ecosystem became a smelly place full of trash and sludge. However, the Landfill Recovery Project began in 1996, once again restoring life to the barren wasteland. Plants and animals returned to the area and it was christened the World Cup Park in May 2002. Each of the five divisions of the World Cup Park (Pyounghwa Park, Haneul Park, Noeul Park, Nanjicheon Park, and Nanji Hangang Park) represents an aspect of the radical transformation of Nanjido back into an ecological haven.<br>

Although the park is open to visitors during the daytime, the park is usually closed at night to reduce the negative effects of visitors on the native plants and animals.

(Seosaengpo Japanese Fortress) is a  stone fortress typical 
of the Japanese style popular in the later part of the 16th century. It was built under the leadership of Japanese General Kato Kiyomasa  in 
1592-1593 at the beginning of the Imjinwaeran War (Japanese invasion, 1592-1598). The main fortress is located on a mountaintop 200 meters above 
sea level, a  second fortress is halfway down the mountain, and a  third fortress is 
located at the bottom of the mountain. The  whole fortress is rectangular shaped. The fortress wall is 6 meters high and slants at an angle of 15 degrees.<br> 

<br>In 1594, a Buddhist monk named&nbsp;Samyeong-daesa came to Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress four times to negotiate for peace, but he failed each time. In 1598, the fortress was taken over 
by Korea with the assistance of General Magwi of the Ming dynasty. A year later, Changpyodang Shrine was built in honor of 53 Koreans 
who died during battles against the Japanese invading forces. However, the shrine was destroyed during the Japanese imperialism period and no 
trace of it remains. It is possible to tell from Seosaengpo Jinseongdo (a map drawn up in 1872) that the fortress was also partially used by  Korean forces.|5|+82-52-204-0324|Seosaengpo Waeseong Fortress (서생포왜성)|45013|A02|A02|A0201|A02010200|

The Bangi-dong area was originally a low line of hills with an altitude of 30-50m above sea level, but it has been made into flatland for urban development purposes. Tomb numbers 1 to 6 lie on the same hill, while tomb no. 7 and 8 are located on another hill a short distance away.<br><br>
All eight tombs have circular burial mounds. The insides of the a tomb feature a square or rectangular-shaped burial chamber with earthen ground and stone walls, and a passage leading from the tomb entrance to the chamber. However, details of the burial chambers vary by tomb. Most of the tombs had been robbed before the investigation, but a few relics such as plates and pots have been excavated. At the time of excavation, the relics were presumed to have come from the Baekje dynasty (18 BC-660 AD), but it is now estimated that they date back to the Unified Silla Period (676-935 AD).|18|+82-2-2147-2800|Seoul Bangidong Ancient Tombs (서울 방이동 고분군)|05644|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

It was established under the direct administration of the Uijeongbu (State Council), combining the Gwangjewon (under the Home Ministry), Gyeongseong Medical School and the Korean Red Cross Hospital (under the Royal Household). 

Built in the Madubong Hill area, this location where Hamchunwon, the outer garden of Changgyeonggung Palace, once stood in 1484 (15th year of King Seongjong), was also once the site of Gyeongmogung Palace, where King Jeongjo enshrined the mortuary tablet of his birth father Crown Prince Sado Seja in 1776 (the year King Jeongjo ascended to the throne). 
<br><br>
These places that held importance for the royal family were destroyed as the Japanese built Gyeongseong Empire University in its place. In 1907, with the announcement of the plan to establish Daehan Medical Center, construction began on the main building, seven wards and affiliated buildings.  Construction was completed in November 1908. 
<br><br>
The Daehan Medical Center opened in Gwangjewon, but upon Japanese colonization in 1910, its name was changed to the Japanese Viceroyalty Hospital. In 1926, it was included as a part of Gyeongseongjeguk University to become a university hospital.

In 1891, Myeongdong Cathedral's head priest Doucet laid down the foundation stone in Hap-dong. Coadjutor bishop Coste was in charge of design and construction and the building was eventually completed in 1892. The church was named after "Yakjeonhyeon," or a hill of medicinal herbs. This is because the place where the church is located was once a hilly area covered with medicinal herbs. Later on, Yakjeonhyeon was shortened to Yakhyeon and it became the name of the hilly area between Malli-dong and Seoul Station.

In those days, the church was known as a “baekjeong church” since it primarily drew Korea’s social underdogs such baekjeong (the butchers), the untouchable class of Joseon society. <br><br>

Following a number of relocations and name changes (called “Gondanggol,” “Jungang,” and finally “Seungdong”) the church was moved to its current location in Insadong. After Moore died in 1906, Charles Allen Clark became the pastor of the church and Mongyang Yuh Woon-hyung, a key figure in the political history of Joseon, became active in the church. The church was attended by many other activists as well. In fact, the large student demonstration that took place during the March 1st Independence Movement in 1919 was organized by a group of young church members. The church once again made its mark on history with the establishment of the Joseon Theological Seminary in 1939. <br><br>

The owner of Mabongnim Halmeoni Tteokbokki restaurant says tteokbokki was being sold as early as 1953 as the area used to be home to Donga Theater and she sold tteokbokki, corn and potatoes to those visiting the theater. At first, tteokbokki was simply made with gochu jang but as time went by, cooks decided the dish could be more than just a snack. By adding ingredients like eggs, cellophane noodles, fish cakes, instant noodles and more recently squid, prawn and cheese, tteokbokki can be made more delicious and turns this beloved snack into a full meal.|24|+82-2-2236-9135|Sindang-dong Tteokbokki Town (신당동떡볶이골목)|04611|A02|A02|A0203|A02030600|

In fact, many visit because of its close proximity to Sogongwon.  Sinheungsa is a temple which used to be called Hyangseongsa, built by Jajangyulsa (590~658), who traveled to famous mountains all over the nation, in Queen Jindeok’s (?~654) 6th year of reign. It was destroyed and rebuilt many times since.
<br><br>
On the path to Sinheungsa, there is a great bronze statue called Bronze Jwabul Statue, which is well over 10 meters high.  Just beyond the statue, which is on a granite terrace, there is a bridge to the right called Hyeonsugyo, which was newly built for crossing the ravine.  Past the bridge there is a long stone wall with a Cheongwang door, and you can enter the temple.  At the entrance there are four Cheonwang (king) statues (Jiguk Cheonwang with a sword, Damun Cheonwang with a lute, Gwangmok Cheonwang with a tower, and Jeungjang Cheonwang with a dragon), placed on either side.  The Buddhist statues at Sinheungsa were placed here during the founding days of Seongjeongsa, and include the statues Mireukbosal, Gwaneumbosal and Seji which were sculpted by Uisang Daesa.  The buildings which were built during that time are still standing, like the sanctuary, main temple, Myeongbujeon, Bojaeru, and Chilseonggak, etc.  There is also an important cultural property, Treasure No. 443, called Hyangseongsaji, a three-story stone tower.

<b>Island History<br></b>
The name of "Soando" comes from the courage of the early island settlers, comprised mostly of the Oh Family of Dongbok and the Kim Family of Gimhae, that had long served as a basis for protection and happiness during the Imjinwaeran (Japanese Invasion).<br><br>
Soando Island is essentially one of the "Holy Lands" of the anti-Japanese colonialism movement. Patriots like Song Nae-ho, who fought hard for independence of Korea from Japan, are remembered on the island. Furthermore, a memorial hall, which houses the Anti-Japanese Colonialism Monument, was established by the islanders in honor of the patriots.|18|+82-61-550-6541|Soando Island (소안도)|59165|A01|A01|A0101|A01011300|

The tranquil Socheongdo Island&nbsp;has a rather sad history. Some days after the liberation from Japanese occupation, three mines floated onto the shores of the island, one of them exploding on landing. The islanders began dismantling the remaining two as a means of fuel. After successfully dismantling the first one, the last one exploded, killing 59 people and injuring 8. There is a monument on the pier front in the main village that memorializes the deceased from the tragic accident.

Maemuldo Island's name originated from the fact that the area was one of the largest producers of<em> maemul</em> (buckwheat).

In 1904, The Kims from Gimhae moved here from the mainland as they heard that the island was so abundant in food that no one would starve. The Kims settled here and established a whole village.

Mountain, and  is a famous <em>sambosachal</em> in Korea.  <em>Sambo</em> means "three treasures" in Korean, and 
in Buddhism there is <em>bulbo</em>, <em>beopbo</em>, and <em>seungbo</em>.  Songgwangsa Temple qualifies as a seungbo temple, which refers to the disciples and practicioners of Buddhism at the temple.  The reason Songgwangsa Temple became a seungbo temple is because many high monks were produced from this temple.  
<br>
<br>
The road to the temple is covered by beautiful tall  trees.  If you cross the 
valley from the road, a  bridge called Cheongryanggak appears.  On the bridge is a pavilion, where you can have a rest. Inside the temple, you can see the Daeungbojeon,  the main building. This building has a roof shaped to look like it has two roofs. To one side of the main building is Jijangjeon Shrine, where there is a statue of Buddha, and Seungbojeon Shrine, which tells the world that this is a seungbo temple. 
<br>

<br>
Songgwangsa Temple has three great treasures: the Bisari Gusi, Ssanghyangsu, and Neunggyeonnansa. Bisari Gusi is a rice container that was made from a large tree. It was used to store the rice for monks, and because it was so large, it contained enough rice for 4,000 monks.  Ssanghyangsu refers to&nbsp;two  large Chinese Juniper trees. Lastly, Neunggyeonnansa is a plate belonging to Songgwangsa Temple, and it was built with many intricate designs. Make time on your trip to see the many national treasures that are located here.|11|+82-61-755-0107|Songgwangsa Temple (Suncheon) (송광사 (순천))|57913|A02|A02|A0201|A02010800|

For many years the temple lay incomplete until Monk Bojo Chejing began reconstruction in the 7th year of King Gyeongmun of Silla (AD 867). The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> 

One of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets: Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.
<br><br>
Beloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year. In spring, many tourists flock to the area to explore the temple and walk through the nearby cherry blossom tunnels.

The valley is surrounded by Bobaesan Mountain, Gunjasan Mountain and Bihaksan Mountain and clear water flows all year down the walls of a series of unique rock formations. 
<br><br>
Thanks to its scenic beauty, many Confucian scholars used to visit here to enjoy literature and nature. 
<br><br>
Ssanggok Valley is composed of nine valleys and each has its own unique atmosphere. 
<br><br>
The first valley, Holongso, flows into a swamp area with many old pine trees nearby creating a picturesque view. The second valley is called Sogeumgang and it is said that its appearance changes with every season. Tteokbawi (rice cake rock) Valley gets its name from the shape it takes on, which is like a sliced rice cake. Similar to the first valley, Munsuam Valley, the fourth valley also has water flowing over uniquely shaped rocks with many old pine trees and flora. The fifth valley has quite a view of parallel rocks on both sides, while the sixth valley offers magnificent vistas of water flowing into a pool formed by the rocks. The water cascading down a huge boulder is said to look like the pleats of a woman’s skirt unfolding at the seventh valley. The eighth valley gathers water into a pond shape from the waterfall; legend says that fairies bathe here. The ninth valley is wide and refreshingly cool even during the hottest summer months.|1|+82-43-832-5550|Ssanggok Valley (쌍곡구곡)|28021|A01|A01|A0101|A01010900|

The cave measures approximately 400m in length, 6m in x_width, and 3m in x_height. It is thought to have been created by lava that erupted from Hallasan Mountain some 25 million years ago. 
<br><br>
One of the unique features of this particular cave is that it has features of both a lava tube and a limestone cave. The entire area surrounding the cave is a huge stratum of seashells and sand, while the interior is a mystical mix of stalactites and stalagmites. Lime covers the cave walls in series of natural swirls and streaks, bringing to mind the strokes of an abstract painting. Since the cave stays at a constant 17-18℃ throughout the year, it’s a welcome escape from the heat in the summer and a great place to warm up in the winter. 
<br><br>
The cave gets its name from its two branches, which are said to look like the paths of two dragons (‘Ssangyong’ meaning ‘two dragons’ in Korean). It is thought that Ssangyonggul Cave and Hyeopjaegul Cave were once one cave since the second entrance of Ssangyonggul Cave is so close to the end of Hyeopjaegul Cave.|4|+82-64-796-0001|Ssangyonggul Cave (Hallim Park) [쌍용굴 (한림공원)]|63011|A01|A01|A0101|A01011900|

Known as the first naturally yielding hot springs that started to flow 30,000 years ago, its effect is also widely recognized. Gushing out from 100 m underground, its water is weak alkaline in nature, and the temperature is 53℃. What's more, the water contains minerals and far-infrared effect. This is why a large number of people flock to the hot springs for treatment and recuperation. Currently, it is under the jurisdiction of Chungju-si City.<br>
<br>
At the center of Suanbo Hot Springs is Multang Park, with a shallow hot spring water stream, which is used as a foot bath. For those who are not able to take a bath, a foot bath is a good option. The foot bath is especially popular from autumn to spring. <br><br>

Most visitors to Suanbo Hot Springs stay at a hotel or motel in the area. The restaurants here serve pheasant dishes, the local specialty. <br>
Suanbo Hot Springs Special Tourist Zone is adjacent to the national road that spans from downtown Chungju-si City to Mungyeong. Sitting in the heart of the Korean Peninsula, it is easy to access from Seoul and other provincial cities. Apart from the hot springs, there is a lot to see in this area, such as Woraksan Mountain, Chungjuho Lake and Songgye Valley. It is a great opportunity to immerse ones' tired body in the hot spring water after a long hike. <br><br>

On the night of his brief stopover, Monk Wonhyo was awoken from his sleep by a powerful thirst. Luckily, he found a bowl full of water and drank it before falling back to sleep. The next morning, he was very surprised to discover that the bowl he had drunk from was in fact an old skull. Out of this shock grew the realization that truth can only be found in one’s mind and not through any outside circumstance. In light of this new awakening, the Great Monk Wonhyo decided not to go to Tang, but rather to stay and continue his search for true salvation while delivering Buddha’s teachings to the masses. <br><br>

During his ministry, Monk Wonhyo preached Buddha’s teachings through the use of everyday food, emphasizing the idea that healthy food cleanses the body and enriches the soul, leading to true salvation. Under these same principles, Sudosa Temple now operates traditional temple food and temple experience programs that allow visitors to gain a deeper understanding of Monk Wonhyo’s beliefs. <br><br>


Programs currently available include: Temple Etiquette Learning Buddhist Service, 108 Prostration (repenting 108 times), Barugongyang (monk’s table manner), Tea & Dining Etiquette, Making Lotus Lamps, Walking Barefoot among the Pines, Feet Cleansing Ceremony, Listening to Meditation Music, Contemplating Buddhist Scripture, and Cultivating Kitchen Gardens. At the temple, visitors can also learn how to cook Korea’s traditional temple food, which is one of the major pillars of Buddhist culture. <br><br>

Nestled in Joan-myeon of Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, the temple has a commanding view over Bukhangang River, which is rated to have one of the most magnificent views. <br><br>According to an old tale, the temple was founded after King Sejo (1417-1468) spent a night in Yangsu-ri region on his way back from Geumgangsan Mountain. As the king was enjoying the night view, he heard clear ringing sounds of a bell. Next day, when the villagers were asked where this sound had come from, they answered the only place they suspect would be the old temple site in Ungilsan Mountain away from the village. When King Sejo sent people to investigate, they found an old temple site inside a cave with statues of the Eighteen Arhats. They also found out that the source of bell sounds were not from an actual bell, but it was a sound made from water droplets falling onto a rock surface. Upon knowing this, the king ordered to raise a temple at the site and named the temple “Sujongsa,” meaning “temple of water bell.” The temple since then had gone through many reconstructions and expansions, which were severely damaged during the Korean War. In 1975, Monk Hyegwang began repairs, starting with Daeungbojeon Hall and slowly expanded the temple site subsequently.|9|+82-31-576-8411|Sujongsa Temple (수종사)|12280|A02|A02|A0201|A02010800|

Tapsa Temple is famous for the over 80 stone pagodas built by Lee Gapyong, a retired scholar. Those stone pagodas have different sizes and shapes from cone-shaped to straight-shaped. Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult’s x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800's entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>
Tapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk). This road is the venue for Maisan Cherry Blossom Festival as well.

* Cheonjitap is comprised of two twin pagodas with x_heights of 13.5m and placed in the south and north directions.

Mountain truly spectacular. It consists of numerous peaks, and is known to be well-preserved and clean. 'Ten Scenic Views of Jirisan
Mountain' are particular memorable and simply breathtaking.
<br><Br>
Perhaps Jirisan Mountain’s most signature highlight is its incredible sunrise; the scarlet sunlight from the horizon in the east is spectacular, and arguably the best place to watch it in Korea. The second highlight is the 'Nogodan Sea of Clouds.'  Located to the west of Jirisan 
Mountain, Nogodan Peak is said to boast the most outstanding views of Jirisan 
Mountain. If you climb up to the peak following the Hwaeomsa Valley, at times the sea of clouds are visible from below the peak. The third notable highlight is 'Banyabong’s Nakjo.' Banyabong Peak is a huge dome shaped feature. One of the big joys of climbing Banyabong is to see the Nakjo. The fourth selected highlight is the full moon; the beautiful scarlet sky together with the black mountain line produce an exquisite painted background to the rising of the moon. The fifth notable feature is the red sunset seen through the mountain haze. The sixth is the deep waterfall between the peaks of Cheonghakbong and Baekhakbong. The 60m fall produces a tremendous sound. The seventh of Jirisan's highlights is Piagol Autumn Leaves. At the village, walk 10 minutes further towards Piagol and you will come to a pine forest at the edge of Jeollanam-do and Gyeongsangnam-do. It is called Piagol, the best broad-leaved tree forest in Jirisan 
Mountain area. In the spring, you will see the Azaleas, in the summer the green trees, and in the fall, the autumn leaves, and in the winter, the beautiful view of snow-covered landscape. But the autumnal colors of Piagol are some of the best in the world. Every year the Autumn Leaves Festival is held here. The eighth highlight is the royal azalea blossoming between the rocks. In the spring, the royal azaleas blanket the mountain. There is a field that extends 1200m in the southern area of Jirisan 
Mountain covered with flowers known as Royal Azalea Plateau. The ninth feature is the Chilseon Valley. With its roots in Cheonwonbong Peak, it is one of our nation’s three best valleys. According to legend, seven gods are said to be living in Chilseondong Valley. Finally, the tenth most scenic feature is Seomjincheongryu. Flowing southwesterly across Jirisan Mountain and into the south coast, the Seomjingang River is so clear that it is sometimes compared to blue silk. The white sandy beaches on either side of the river are also very beautiful.|5|No tel|Ten Scenic Views of Jirisan (지리산 10경)|No zipcode|A01|A01|A0101|A01010100|

He is also known as King 
Guhae or King Yang, and is the grandfather of Kim Yoo Shin. Since becoming 
the King of Gaya in 521 CE, he reigned for 11 years until he handed over his 
country to King Beopheung of the Silla Kingdom in 532 CE.<br><br>There are two 
different scholarly opinions  about this tomb. One is that it should be classified&nbsp;as a stone pagoda and the 
other, a royal tomb. The reason why this was regarded as a pagoda is 
that there are similarly shaped stone pagodas in the Andong and Uiseong regions. 
The basis for it being called Wangreung, or royal tomb, is that there is a record in Dongguk Yeoji Seongram (an 
ancient history book published during the rule of King Seongjong in the Joseon Dynasty) and 
in Saneum-hyeon Sancheonjo (a record of events in the region) of it being a 
tomb. The 
notes state that "there is a structure with steps on 
the four faces, in the form of nine dragons piled up of stones at a distance 
of about 16 km (40 ri&nbsp;in traditional Korean scale) from the village, so 
people believe it must be a royal tomb".<br><br> The record describing the name of the king buried 
in this tomb can be extracted from a record of travels called Wangsan Shimreunggi 
written by Hong Ui Young, a Joseon Dynasty scholar. In addition, there’s also 
an entry&nbsp; in Wangsansagi, a book on the history of Wangsansa Temple (a 
temple located  west of the tomb) that the person buried in the tomb is King Guhyeong.<br><br>Unlike ordinary 
graves, the tomb is built at&nbsp;the middle part of the hill's slope. The tomb 
has a unique appearance made up of steps and layers, with the highest point 
being 7.15 meters high. There are seven layers at the front and no steps at 
the back due to it being built on an inclined surface. The overall shape of 
this tomb is different from the pyramids built on level ground.  The top of the tomb is  oval in 
shape. At the center, there is a stone tablet with the words "Royal Tomb of King Yang of the 
Garak Nation". In front of the tomb, there are several stone pieces that 
have been added to the original tomb. <br><br>During the 17th Year of King 
Jeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty (1793), a wooden box that was passed down from generation 
to generation in Wangsansa<i> </i>Temple was discovered. The box contained portraits 
of King Guhyeong and his queen, their clothes, an archery bow, and other objects. To 
preserve these, a royal building called Deogyangjeon Hall was 
constructed. To this date, a memorial service is held here in spring and 
autumn of every year.<br>

Such traces are particularly distinct in Uhangri, Haenam-gun. The Uhangri area had originally been a part of the sea, but this changed when the Damsuho Lake and surrounding area was formed by the building of the Geumho Tide Embankment. This lake has a sea cliff that is 3-4 meters high, stretches about 5km in length, and is made up of sedimentary rock formed during the Cretaceous age. Embedded in the rock around the lake are footprints of dinosaurs, pterosaurs and water birds that lived in this area tens of millions of years ago. There is no other place in the world where footprint fossils of all these different dinosaurs were found in a single area. The footprint fossil of a pterosaur discovered in this area is the largest in the world at a length of 20-35cm.

King Gyeongjong was the first son of King Sukjong and Janghuibin, who was one of King Sukjong’s concubines. King Gyeongjong, who was born weak and anemic, died four years after becoming the king, without any great political achievements. As a result, Queen Seonui became the crown princess in 1718 and queen in 1720 when King Gyeongjong ascended to the throne. She is known to have had a kind heart and prudent personality.<br><br>
Uireung’s tombs differ from the other royal double tombs in that they are not placed side-by-side. Instead, according to geomantic theory, one tomb has been placed directly behind the other one.

<br><br>
The reservoir is 1.8 kilometers in circumference and 151,470 square meters in water surface area and has a water level of 8-13 meters. It supplies water to around 289.4 jeongbos (unit) of farmland and was one of the 3 major reservoirs of the Samhan Era along with Byeokgolje of Gimje and Susanje of Miryang. With a water gate built of onggi (earthenware), Uirimji is also a valuable historical site for studying farming methods. 
<br><br>
The reservoir is one of the main tourist attractions of Jecheon. Attractions around the reservoir include Yeonghojeong Pavilion (erected in 1807 in the 7th year of King Sunjo) and Gyeonghoru Pavilion (built in 1948). The traditional beauty of the structures is accented by the neighboring ancient pine and willow trees and the 30 meter-high waterfall. Nearby attractions include the Pine Field Park, National Archery Field, and Parkland.

Hongnyeonam Hermitage is a place you shouldn’t miss when you visit the octagonal Uisangdae. Believed to be built 5 years after Naksansa Temple, it is also where Great Monk Uisang used to meditate.

It is built against the cliff beside a rocky cave, making it part of a great scenery, and the sunrise from Uisangdae is absolutely spectacular. <br><br>Songgang Jeongcheol, who was a poet from the mid Joseon Period (1392-1910) expressed his feeling on the spectacle of sunrise from Uisangdae like this: “After the pear-tree flowers have fallen and when the cuckoo cries sadly, beyond the hill east of Naksan Mountain at Uisangdae, I get up in the middle of night to see the sun rise. The auspicious clouds look like they are blooming, and the sun look as if it is being held up by six dragons.

The building was once a home to the famous artist, Heo Yu during his last years, after his master Kim Jeong-hee (1789~1856), a noted scholar, passed away.
<br>
Ullimsanbang House was named after the romantic scenery of the mountain peaks nearby the Cheomchalsan Maountain that appears hazily amidst the foggy mist. According to Heo Yu’s writings, ‘Mongyeonrok’ once had various flowers and trees blossomed, but it had long been abandoned beyond recognition until it was restored by his grandson, Heo Geon (1907~1987) in 1982.
<br>
Surrounding the Cheomchalsan Mountain, Ullimsanbang House has a C-shaped tile-roofed house containing a workroom among numerous bedrooms. It houses a wooden cottage at the rear and the So-Chi (Heo Geon’s pen name) Memorial to the right. Many of Heo family’s artworks are displayed here. At the middle of the courtyard, a crape myrtle stands gracefully on a small six-meter island floating on a pond of lilies.

<br>
*Ullimsanbang House was one of the filming locations for the movie "Scandal(2003)." The scene where the three main actors were on a boat ride was shot here.|21|No tel|Ullimsanbang House (진도 운림산방)|58934|A02|A02|A0201|A02010400|

The residence belonged to Heungseon Daewongun, Emperor Gojong's father and was where the emperor-to-be grew up as a child. Although the residence was to serve as a private home for the royal family rather than a place for political affairs, some of the most historically important events took place within the walls of Unhyeongung Royal Residence towards the end of Joseon dynasty. <br><br>
When Gojong was appointed as king at an early age, Heungseon Daewongun rose in power as king regent. During this time, Unhyeongung Royal Residence went through upscaling renovations, increasing in size and grandeur. After Heungseon Daewongun stepped down from regency, Unhyeongung Royal Residence's reputation slowly deteriorated as the family went through financial difficulties and could not afford to maintain the facilities. The ownership of the residence was confiscated by the Japanese administration in 1912, then returned to Heungseon Daewongun's descendants in 1948. The complex was then donated to and purchased by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, followed by renovation efforts in 1993 to recover and preserve whatever was left of the historical site.|23|+82-2-766-9090|Unhyeongung Royal Residence (운현궁)|03131|A02|A02|A0201|A02010100|

The park is located near Seoul World Cup Stadium, and is made up of five smaller parks - <em>Pyeonghwa</em> (Peace) Park, <em>Haneul</em> (Sky) Park, <em>Noeul</em> (Sunset) Park, Nanjicheon Park, and Nanji Hangang Park.

<br /><br>


 * Pyeonghwa Park: Closest to Seoul World Cup Stadium, it holds a pond, garden, children’s playground, and forest. As a representative park of World Cup Park, the park was designed in hopes of peace and harmony between mankind and nature. It is often used as a picnic area and place for nature studies. 

<br><br />


 * Nanji Hangang Park: Nanji Hangang Park was developed on the banks of the Hangang River. In contrast to other Hangang River parks, Nanji Hangang Park is a water-friendly park that has a gradual slope towards the riverbank. The park consists of a camping ground, soccer field, basketball court, grass field, cruise ship port, and an area for nature studies.
<br><br>


 * Haneul Park: Haneul Park consists of vast grassland located at the highest elevation of the five parks. The park's pasture is covered with eulalias and wild flowers in their most natural state. In addition, 30,000 butterflies of different species were introduced in 2000 to stabilize the ecosystem. Five wind-powered generators provide power to the park and the park’s maintenance office. Once a mountain of garbage, it is now a green hill with 22 lookout points offering breathtaking views of Seoul, including the N Seoul Tower, Bukhansan Mountain, and Hangang River. Tall trees are line the park to provide shades and serve as resting spots for visitors. As a popular spot to enjoy the sight of eulalias, the park usually remains open until late in the evening during the Eulalia Festival period.

<br><br />

 * Noeul Park: In order to prevent the vast area of land of what was once a wasteland from becoming an unnecessary chunk of land, a nine-hole golf course was constructed in what is now known as Noeul Park. The golf course serves as an environment friendly entertainment park to visitors while stabilizing the geographical formation and has an urban park nearby that offers scenic views of the Hangang River and beautiful sunset. Located west of the golf park is Noeul Square, decorated with shrubs and flowers. 

<br><br />


 * Nanjicheon Park: Nanjicheon Park was developed from the Nanji Stream, which flowed under Haneul Park. It was once overflowing with sewage runoff from a nearby landfill, but it has since been beautifully restored into a park with clear water. The park is built to serve as a recreational spot for those with for youths, elders, and people with disabilities.|13|+82-2-120|World Cup Park (월드컵공원)|03901|A02|A02|A0202|A02020700|

The time of Yeongguksa Temple's construction is not clearly known but it is said to have been built around the late Silla period, during the time of King Seonjong. The temple prospered when the State Preceptor Wongak, who completed the Cheontae, one of Buddhist orders from Daegak Guksa Uicheon, came to the temple in the middle of the Goryeo period. It continued to flourish until the early Joseon era and then took a dive due to the rule of anti-Buddhism. Despite the situation at the time, the temple's reputation as one of the noted temples remained. However, the situation worsened in the early twentith century, to the point of near closure. The temple was reconstructed by Jubongjosa Monk in 1934. <br><br>

As of now, the temple contains various treasures including the Stele for State Preceptor Wongak, Stupa of Yeongguksa Temple, Three-story Stone Pagoda of Yeongguksa Temple, Three-story Stone Pagoda at Mangtapbong Peak of Yeongguksa Temple.

The social hierarchy was very strict during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), and it influenced the patterns of the royal tombs.  The tombs for kings and queens called ‘neung’ are larger and more luxurious than tombs for princes and consorts called ‘won.’
<br><BR>
Yeonghwiwon houses the tomb of Queen Consort Sunheon (1854-1911), King Gojong’s concubine and Sunginwon is for King Yeongchin’s son, Ijin (1921-1923).  The composition of the two tombs is similar, but Yeonghwiwon is larger than Sunginwon.  The first sight when entering the burial grounds is the red gate (the red color denoting holiness).  Beyond the red gate is a sacrificial building where the memorial rites were performed.  Behind the sacrificial building is the royal tomb.  On the eaves of the sacrificial building are stone sculptures called japsang, which are carved into the shapes of animals such as monkeys and are believed to exorcise evil spirits.  There is a pavilion next to the sacrificial building where the tombstone is located.  The tombstone indicates who lies in the mound.  The stone figures guarding the king’s tomb are memorable.  A sacrificial building called "jasil" is now used as maintenance office and is worth visiting.  The eaves, latticework and wooden floor are so well preserved that visitors can truly get an authentic feeling when walking through the premises.

Because there are many swallows on the island, it used be called Jayeondo Island as well.  Because it is connected now by Yeongjong Bridge to the mainland, it no longer has the proper atmosphere of an island, but since the building of Incheon International Airport, many tourists have been coming here to visit.  
<br><br>
At the center of the island is Bakeunsan Mountain, and there are highways circling around it. Baekun Mountain is famous for its Yonggungsa temple, where Regent is said to have lived for 10 years, and its mineral mountain water spring.  In front of Yonggungsa temple, there is a 1,300-year-old zelkova tree, adding to the ancient atmosphere of the place.  If you walk up to the top of Baekunsan Mountain, you can see Incheon International Airport and its surrounding area. The area has Yeongjong Sky Park and Baekunsan Mountain Gliding Range, so you can enjoy some exciting sports here. At Yeongjong Sky Park, you can learn basic flight skills with light planes, so even beginners can experience flying planes here. The bathhouse near the seashore uses hot spring water, and so the water is very good here.

Flowing down from Sobaeksan Mountain and Taebaeksan Mountain, Naeseongcheon Stream and Yeongjucheon Stream converge and loop around Museom Village, surrounding the village on three sides with water. The island-like village is not only a center of traditional Korean culture, but also has a gorgeous natural landscape complete with a wide sandy beach riverside and a lush forest inland.<br><br>

Known for Haeudang and Manjukje houses (two of the most historical hanok houses in the area), the village is also home to other outstanding traditional houses such as the Kim Gyu-jin House and the Kim Wi-jin House. Manjukje is located at the heart of the village and is popular among international visitors, as it is the oldest traditional house in the hanok village. Manjukje was built in 1666 (7th year of King Heonjong's reign) by Bak Su (the father of the Bannam Bak Family).<br><br> 

Nearby Manjukje is Manun House, built in the early 19th century and named after Kim Hwi-geol (penname “Manun”). The house later became the home of the wife of the famous poet Jo Ji-hun, author of “Byeolli,” a poem expressing the beauty of Museom Village.<br><br>

Other notable houses include the Kim Jin-wi House (a house belonging to aristocrats), the Kim Jeong-gyu House (a house without the traditional outer fencing), and the Bak Jae-yeon House, where the writings of Bak Gyu-su (a scholar belonging to the Silhakpa school of thought during the late Joseon Period) still remain today.<br><br> 

Another famous attraction in the village is the Single Log Bridge, which was the village’s only connection to the outside world for over 350 years before the construction of Sudo Bridge in 1979. It is a tiny bridge in terms of x_width (30 cm), but it stretches for over 150 meters. It is said that the bridge was rebuilt annually after being destroyed each rainy season. With the construction of Sudo Bridge, the Single Log Bridge was no longer needed, but was rebuilt some time later in its original form. To celebrate the bridge’s impressive history, each year the Oenamu Dari Festival (literally, “Single Log Bridge Festival”) is held in October.|14|+82-54-634-0040|Yeongju Museom Village (영주 무섬마을)|36173|A02|A02|A0201|A02010600|

This was the first joint royal tomb of the Joseon dynasty.<br>
<br>
 King Sejong was the third son of the third ruler, King Taejong, and his wife Queen Wongyeong. He came to the throne at the age of 22. During his 32-year reign, he was very influential in the development of Korean culture. For example, King Sejong created the Korean alphabet, which he called Hunminjeongeum, and set up the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon), an association of the kingdom’s brightest scholars. He also used Confucian principles to administer state affairs. Under the reign of King Sejong, therefore, many sectors including politics, economy, society and culture flourished. In fact, King Sejong the Great is regarded as making some of the most brilliant achievements in Korean history. <br>
<br>
 Yeongneung is currently located in Neungseo-myeon in Yeoju-si in Gyeonggi-do, but the tomb was originally located in Seogang, Gwangju. When it was constructed following Queen Soheon’s death in 1446, it was decided it should be a joint tomb, and the space on the right side was reserved for King Sejong. In 1450 when King Sejong died, he was buried together with the dead queen. Later, the tomb was moved to its current place, as it was thought that the original location was not an auspicious place according to geomantic traditions.<br>
<br>
 Various items that were originally buried in the tomb were excavated in 1973 and now are exhibited in the King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall, which is located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. <br>
<br>
 Nyeongneung is the royal tomb of the 17th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, King Hyojong (1619-1659, reign 1649-1659), and of his wife Queen Inseon (1618-1674).<br>
<br>
 The tomb was originally located to the west of Geonwolleung (the tomb of King Taejo, the first ruler of the Joseon dynasty), but in 1673 cracks appeared on the tomb’s “Byeongpungseok” (stone border), and it was moved to its current location, which is to the east of Yeongneung (the tomb of King Sejong).<br>
<br>
 King Hyojong was the second son of King Injo, Joseon dynasty’s 16th ruler, and Queen Illyeol. Upon ascending to the throne, he devised a plan to conquer the northern region of Asia, including the Qing Dynasty (part of China). As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements. When a group of Dutch sailors were shipwrecked on the Korean shore, King Hyojong ordered them to build the Korean army’s first muskets. <br>
<br> King Hyojong also implemented “Daedongbeop,” a tax system under which people had to pay taxes with rice, and circulated “Sangpyeongtongbo,” the coinage of the Joseon dynasty.|20|+82-31-880-4700|Yeongneung & Nyeongneung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (여주 영릉(英陵)과 영릉(寧陵) [유네스코 세계문화유산])|12642|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

The soil of Mount Yeoninsan is fertile, offering a great natural environment for a variety of flowers and trees. Numerous types of wild flowers thrive from early spring to late autumn. The trail connecting Mount Yeoninsan with mounts Myeongjisan, Cheonggyesan, and Gwimokbong remains relatively unspoiled by human influence: cooking and camping in the area is strictly forbidden. All the mountains in the trail are over 1,000 meters high. A defining feature of Mount Yeoninsan is the royal azaleas that bloom in late May. The County of Gapyeong celebrates the royal azalea by hosting the Mount Yeoninsan (Natural Ecology) Festival in May of each year.  
<br><br>
Also ideal for hiking, Mount Yeoninsan offers a number of trails: one starts from Buk-myeon in Baekdun-ri, one from Mail-ri, and one from Yongchu Valley. With a minimum of climbing, hikers can take in a variety of scenic views, ranging from the bloom of the royal azaleas in the spring to the beauty of the changing leaves in the fall.|1|+82-31-8008-8140|Yeoninsan Provincial Park (연인산도립공원)|12408|A01|A01|A0101|A01010200|

Despite the tragic incident of November 2010 shelling from North Korea, this bucolic island offers many natural and cultural attractions.<br><br>
<b>Island History<br></b>
The earliest known history of Socheongdo Island comes from Chungmin-sa Temple, which was built to commemorate the island's once abundant but now extinct fish species called Yellow corbina (Sciaenidae). This fish was related to the family of fish commonly called drums, croakers, or hardheads for the repetitive throbbing or drumming sounds they make. When the economy flourished thanks to profitable fishing, the Socheongdo port was congested with fishing boats, so much that it was said that one could cross from one island to the next by walking over boats. The species of fish is depleted, and the island remains as quiet with views of North Korea.<br><br>
In November 2010, Socheongdo Island was hit by the fatal shelling from North Korea that killed two civilians and two soldiers. In recent months, the island has made an attempt to recover its tourism industry and to develop security tourism by blending its newer military presence at tourist attractions.|9|+82-32-899-3450|Yeonpyeongdo Island (연평도(대/소 연평도))|23108|A01|A01|A0101|A01011300|

Upon his arrival, he sighted a pair of golden crows flying above the boat and followed the birds before they disappeared. He found the birds at the temple's current location, drinking from a puddle of water that had an aromatic smell.

However, there are plenty of other stories of how it came to be.  One legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Mt. Halla was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down on Yongduam, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse, who dreamed of being a dragon and ascending to the sky, came to be caught by a soldier and froze into the rock.<br><br>

From Yongduam, visitors can see Haeneo women divers working on catching seafood. Near the rock are various cafes, bars, and restaurants. The coastal road between Aewol-eup and Yongduam is a popular spot for couples. Cafes and seafood restaurants began to appear there five years ago and now form a pleasant café village. <br><br>

Drinking a cup of coffee at the village café and driving along the scenic coastal lines, visitors can encounter Iho Beach where black rocks contrast with the emerald-blue ocean, Hagwi Coast, and Aewol Port. Aewol Port is also home to small seafood restaurants and fishing boats coming in and out, adding flavor to the coastal drive. Further from the port is one of the most popular beaches on Jeju Island, Hyeopjae Beach, showcasing the deep royal-blue sea year-round with splendid white sand.|4|+82-64-740-6000|Yongduam Rock (Dragon Head Rock) (용두암)|63152|A01|A01|A0101|A01011100|

It was originally called Songhyeonsan Mountain, which means a mountain with a view of the sea through the dense pine tree forest. Later, the name was changed to Yongdusan Mountain, as the mountain peak was shaped similar to a dragon's head (<em>yongdu</em>), protecting the area against foreign invaders overseas.<br><br>

The mountain held shrines for the mountain gods built by the Japanese before the 8.15 Liberation. Now the mountain is home to a variety of monuments, including Cheokhwabi Monument, Chunghontap Pagoda, 4.19 Revolution Monument, a statue of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, and Busan Tower. During the Korea War, refugees built houses on the sides of the mountain all the way to the summit but these neighborhoods were burned down twice, leaving the mountain bare. Since then, fierce efforts of planting trees have led to transforming the burnt mountain to a beautiful park. The park was called Unam Park at the time of the Liberal Party’s ruling but was renamed to Yongdusan Park after the April 19 Revolution in 1960. The park offers a beautiful view of Busan Port and the surrounding scenery. In particular, the night view from Busan tower is magnificent.|15|No tel|Yongdusan Park (용두산공원)|48950|A02|A02|A0202|A02020700|

During the Silla Kingdom (about 1,300 years ago), the temple was named ‘Baegunsa’ by King Munmu, in reference to the temple’s mountain home. During the Joseon dynasty, it was the temporary residence of Heungseon Daewongun (1820-1898, a politician and father of King Gojong), who stayed at the temple for 10 years praying for his son to ascend to the throne. When his son was finally crowned king, Heungseon Daewongun re-built the temple and changed the name to Yonggungsa.
<br><br>
The temple consists of various buildings such as Gwaneumjeon (re-constructed by Heungseon Daewongun), Yosachae (home of the monks), Chilseonggak, and Yonghwanggak. In Yosachae, the writings of Heungseon Daewongun are hung on the wall and recently, an 11 meter-high statue of Maitreya was put in place.

The outskirts of the mountain are full of natural plants such as Ranunculus japonicus, Pulsatilla koreana, and Elsholtzia splendens.<br><br>

The name, Yongnuni Oreum, is derived from the fact that the mountain looks like the shape of a dragon lying down. The large crater in the middle of the hill looks like a place where a dragon used to lay. Some people have argued that the name comes from the crater looking like a dragon's eye when seen from the air.|4|+82-64-740-6000|Yongnuni Oreum (용눈이오름)|63364|A01|A01|A0101|A01010400|

King Jangjo was the father of King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty. <br>
<br>
 King Jangjo was the second son of King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of the Joseon Dynasty. He was installed as a Crown Prince in 1736. As the Crown Prince, he administered the state affairs on behalf of his father and showed great capability in various fields. However, he died in 1762 after being locked in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father, King Yeongjo. <br>
 <br>
 The tomb of this ill-fated Crown Prince was originally located in Baebongsan Mountain located in Yangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do. His son, King Jeongjo moved the tomb to  Hwasan Mountain in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do and changed the title of the tomb to Hyeollyungwon. Later, he posthumously gave his father the title King Jangjo and moved the tomb to its current place, and the title of the tomb was changed again to Yungneung.<br>
<br>
 Queen Heongyeong was designated as a crown princess in 1744. In 1795 when she turned 60 and long after her husband died, she wrote Hanjungnok, the memoirs, which is mainly about the terrible fate of her husband.<br>
 The Memoirs have great historical significance, and these along with the Tales of Queen Inhyeon, are highly valued as pieces of royal literature.<br>
<br>
Yungneung is currently located in Annyeong-dong in Hwaseong. A stone called “Byeongpungseok” surrounds the tomb. On the stone, peony and lotus flowers are engraved. Like other royal tombs, there are two separate spaces – one raised and one lower space. In the raised space, there is the mound, “Honyuseok,” which is a rectangular shaped stone sitting in front of the mound, and "Mangjuseok," which is a pair of stones that sit on both sides of the mound. In the lower spaces, there are several stone statues. They include “Muninseok,” a statue of a civil officer, “Muinseok,” a statue of a military officer, and “Seokma,” a statue of a horse. <br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>Geolleung (건릉)</b> is the joint tomb of King Jeongjo (1752-1800), the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, and Queen Hyoui (1753-1821). <br>
<br>
 King Jeongjo’s last wish was to be buried near his father’s tomb in Yungneung. King Jeongjo was the second son of King Jangjo and Queen Heongyeong, but in 1759, when he was 8 years old, he was designated as an heir to the throne. During his 24 year-reign, King Jeongjo influenced state affairs by implementing the “Tangpyeongchaek (a policy to balance the power of political factions),” and he also had great accomplishments in the area of academic research by creating the “Gyujanggak (a national royal library).” <br>
<br>
 Queen Hyoui was a daughter of Kim Si Muk and was installed as a partner of the heir to the throne at the age of 10. In 1776, when King Jeongjo ascended the throne, she also became Queen. She is known to have led a frugal life. In 1821, she died without an heir at the age of 69 in Jagyeongjeon, Changgyeonggung Palace. <br>
<br> Geolleung looks very similar to Yungneung, but unlike Yungneung, it does not have a “Byeongpungseok,” which is a wide and rectangular stone that surrounds the mound and protects it. Instead, it is surrounded by “Nanganseok,” stone handrails. On every handrail, lotus flowers are engraved. King Jeongjo’s tomb is simpler and less decorated than his father’s, which reflects King Jeongjo’s respect and love for his father. Both Geolleung and Yungneung are designated as Historic Site No. 206.|31|+82-31-222-0142|Yungneung and Geolleung Royal Tombs [UNESCO World Heritage] (화성 융릉(장조,현경왕후)과 건릉(정조,효의왕후) [유네스코 세계문화유산])|18345|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

His mother worried greatly over her son’s wounds.  <br><br>One day she saw a crane with a wounded wing dip itself into a hot spring in the midst of snow covered ground and healed.  She took her son there and his wound was healed as well so the legend goes.  Perhaps because of this legend, the Yuseong Hot Springs is famous for its incredible healing properties.|4|+82-42-611-2076|Yuseong Hot Spring (유성온천지구)|34186|A02|A02|A0202|A02020300|

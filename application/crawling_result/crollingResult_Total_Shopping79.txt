For many years, the market was the go-to-place for necessary items and produce, but with the increase of large marts in the 1990s, people began to visit traditional markets less and less. In order to increase the liveliness of Songjeong Station Market and showcase the difference between large marts and a traditional market, the entire space was redesigned around the theme of time.<br><br>

The newly redesigned 1913 Songjeong Station Market, located just across the street from Gwangju-Songjeong KTX Station, has a bright appearance with modern-styled architecture and signboards detailing the history of the various shops. Visitors can enjoy all the classic market foods here, such as hotteok (hot griddle cakes), gyeran bap (rice with egg), and eomuk (fisk cake).|1|+82-62-960-3866|1913 Songjeong Station Market (1913송정역시장)|62437|A04|A04|A0401|A04010200|

reduced in size as many foreign products are freely imported, but the reputation and potential still remain. Some imported goods including liquor, clothes, ornaments, accessories, fashion items and electronic goods are still sold here. <br><br>

Shop owners in Ganggyeong are renowned for making undeniably great-tasting products and are skilled at distinguishing the good ones from the bad. Hence, the best salted fish products are known to be from Ganggyeong.
<br>	
The Yeomcheon-ri province of Ganggyeong is where merchants distribute enormous supplies of salted fish, such as salted shrimps and yellow corvinas, to the rest of the nation. The trade of salted shrimps from these regions makes up half the entire salted shrimp market in Korea. The Traditional Salted Fish Market becomes crowded from mid-June to the end of November, just before the Kimjang season (season for preparing kimchi for the winter). During this busy season, the market bustles with wholesalers, shop owners, and housewives in search of delicious salted fish. From early August to early December as many as 250 drums of salted fish are sold. Also, the Ganggyeong Traditional Salted Fish Festival which is held every year, is  well worth a visit.|3|No tel|Ganggyeong Traditional Salted Fish Market (강경젓갈시장)|32935|A04|A04|A0401|A04010200|

The Insa-dong area usually refers to the areas extending from the Anguk-dong Rotary to Tapgol Park in Jongno 2(i)-ga, past the Insa-dong Intersection. The notable features of Insa-dong are the countless alleys that branch out from the main street. Insa-dong has also become known as ‘Merry’s Area,’ one of the favorite shopping spots among foreigners.<br><br>
<From Old Books to Pottery><br>
Over forty percent of the nation’s antique stores are clustered in the Insa-dong area, and they 
sell more valuable antiques compared to any other places in Korea. The price of the 
valuables and souvenirs in this area can range from 10,000 won to some hundred million won. Among the antiques sold there are old pictures, pottery, wooden containers and jewelry. There is a variety of artwork varying from earthenware of the Unified Silla Era to white pottery of the Joseon Era. Foreigners from all over the world including Japan, China, France, and America frequent Insa-dong to witness a truly traditional Korean atmosphere.<br><br>
Prices range greatly depending on the customers and the items. Old books are usually popular among the Japanese and Chinese tourists who can identify Hanja (Chinese characters). Antique books are purchased by many visitors, from history professors to antique collectors, at prices varying from 10,000 won to 30,000 won. Highly valued items are not sold and even if they are displayed in the store, as 
some shopkeepers do not intend to sell them. Archaeology and history books are the most popular selections. Some items are priceless so shopkeepers often name their own price, but keep in mind that some stores do 
have price tags to indicate products for sale. Tongmungwan is a representative store selling old books and has been run by a family for three generations. When you enter this small bookstore, you can see old books packed in rows. This bookstore was originally opened by the grandfather of the current shopkeeper, and is living proof of Insa-dong’s long-standing history. This is definitely a place worth visiting even if you do not intend to make a purchase.<br><br>
Traditional Korean ceramic ware is the main artwork Insa-dong has to offer. It is also the most popular item among tourists.  Ceramic ware can be used in everyday life and many also consider it an essential decorative item. Ever since Queen Elizabeth I of England visited Insa-dong in April 1999 and praised the beauty of the ceramic art forms, many tourists from all over the world, including Europe, America, and Japan have become interested in them. Prices may start at 10,000 won, but can cost you up to some 10 million won. The most popular ceramic ware are pottery in the shape of a gourd bottle, costing anywhere from 100,000 won to 200,000 won. Keep in mind that the finer ceramic ware boast a clear color and have a clear resonant sound when tapped with the tip of your fingernail. <br><br>
Famous shops include ‘Park Young Suk Yo’ where Queen Elizabeth paid a visit 
and ‘Haedong Godoja.’ The main artwork offered are the common porcelain ware that have been recrafted, and pots of the Joseon 
 Era. ‘Haedong Godoja’ is known for selling the best quality ceramic ware.<br><br>
‘Goseohwa’ (old paintings and calligraphic arts) is another main form of artwork offered in Insa-dong. There are shops selling old artwork along with oriental paintings, as well as modern paintings. Shops such as Dongmundang and Gonghwarang display and sell old paintings along with calligraphic works.<br><br>
Antique furniture and other items are available at Naraksil and Gayajae. Naraksil offers great quality antique furniture such as bookshelves and bookstands, while Gayajae sells old pieces of furniture, stone Buddhas, and tiles. Other popular antiques can be found at ‘Toto’s Antiques’ where there are contemporary articles from the period before and after the liberation of Korea from Japanese forces. Even though there isn't any traditional artwork at this store, Korean antiques are displayed picturesquely. Toto’s Antiques seems to arouse nostalgia among its visitors, as it is decorated with old schoolbooks, toys, and ornaments from the 50’s and 60’s.<br><br>
 Sunday is designated a pedestrian-friendly day as&nbsp;cars are not permitted 
in the area for on that day of the week. Instead, a flea market opens on this day to sell various antiques, accessories, artwork, and books. Traditional antiques from different parts of Korea as well as international antiques brought by foreign tourists are displayed throughout Insa-dong, allowing visitors to view many items in one glance. It is highly recommended that you visit Insa-dong on Sundays since you can also view the beautiful street art. <br><br>
When shopping in Insa-dong, make sure you check where the product is made. Recently, cheap Chinese goods such as teacups, wall tapestries, and small accessories have been brought into the Insa-dong markets and there have been cases where merchandise thought to be made in Korea turned out to be marked as ‘Made in China.’ So 
if you are looking to purchase only authentic Korean products, be sure to check

Itaewon holds a long history in its making and is the first place most tourists want to visit in Korea. After the U.S. set up a military base in Korea during the 1970s, many foreigners stationed at the base settled near the Itaewon area, naturally developing the region into a shopping district catering to foreigners. Later, the existence of Itaewon became known worldwide after the widely publicized 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Seoul Olympics. In 1997, Itaewon was finally designated as an official tourist zone.
<br>

<br>
 The 1.4 km-long street stretching from Itaewon 1-dong to Hannam 2-dong has been designated as Itaewon Street. There is an enormous variety of shops, entertainment venues, and restaurants for visitors to enjoy. Itaewon is a leader in providing exotic fashion, bars, and clubs in Korea. Most stores in this area are branded with English signs, and now with the recent influx of Japanese and Chinese tourists, Itaewon has become one of Korea’s top international hubs.

The glittering showcases here are especially popular amongst couples and foreign tourists looking to find fine jewelry at affordable prices. Stores in the jewelry district have a selection of designs that are extraordinarily diverse and prices that are 30 to 40% lower than at other jewelry outlets in Korea.<br>
<br>
- A fabulous selection at wholesale prices<br>
The Jongno 3(sam)-ga Jewelry District is located in Jongno, with shops flooding the alleyways all along the main street and stretching for a length of one kilometer. The area holds a total of over 1,000 jewelry stores, some 300 design and manufacturing stores, and 20 licensed evaluators.<br>
<br>
The Jongno 3(sam)-ga Jewelry District originated in Yeji-dong of Jongno 4(sa)-ga, then expanded to include Bongik-dong near the Danseongsa Theater at Jongno 3(sam)-ga. <br>
As the district grew, retail jewelry stores both large and small populated both sides of the main street from Jonggak to Jongno 5(oh)-ga.<br>
Most of the stores in Yeji-dong deal in watches and gemstones, giving the area the name Watch Alley. The back alleys of Bongik-dong and Yeji-dong are mostly filled with wholesalers whose clients consist of brokers and jewelers from around the country. Retail sales are possible at these shops, but some of them might hesitate to deal in small quantities. <br>
The larger stores along Jong-ro literally glitter with dozens of flashy showcases presenting a great selection of jewelry and other precious metals. Prices are already discounted to begin with, but you may be able to bargain even further.<br>
<br>
Stores in this district are affiliated with setting factories, so if you have a special design in mind, you can probably get it custom ordered. Thus, if you go in with a brand name jewelry brochure, they will most likely be able to make a similar looking item or even customize it to your preferences.<br>
In addition to its grand variety of diamonds, rubies, domestic amethysts, and almost any precious stone you can imagine, gold is also available in 14k, 18k and 24k yellow or white, as well as in platinum. Watches are often discounted at 50-60% off the retail price, and of course this is the very best place to buy fancy wedding jewelry at amazingly low prices.<br>
We suggest, however, that you take your time and look around, because prices, not to mention their inventory, will vary significantly from shop to shop.<br>
As soon as a new brochure is published by an international brand such as Cartier, TIFFANY or BVLGARI, near-identical designs appear in these stores almost immediately. <br>
Furthermore, this area has recently become the home of accessories for famous Korean entertainers. Companies in the district will consult with coordinators, then design and manufacture items, and lend them to stars for them to wear. When entertainers wear this jewelry on television, the coverage serves to promote these designs. Examples of designs that have attracted a lot of attention previously, include Lee Seung-yeon’s earrings, Jeon Ji-hyeon’s necklace, Moon Hee-jun’s necklace, Lee Yeong-ae’s earrings, and much more.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, many foreign tourists, especially Japanese tourists,  make the trip to the Jongno 3(sam)-ga Jewelry District, as prices here are much cheaper than in their home countries.<br>
The Jewelry District is conveniently located at the center of Seoul’s major palaces and near the downtown areas. Of these, the closest tourist areas include Myeong-dong, downtown Jong-ro, Dongdaemun Market, and Namdaeumun Market.|23|+82-2-1330|Jongno 3(sam)-ga Jewelry District (종로3가 귀금속 전문상가)|03139|A04|A04|A0401|A04010600|

The street is T-shaped, with a 1km-long main street connected to a 400-meter-long alley, and the Munjeong 1-dong Resident Center located at the center.  For shoppers’ convenience, there is a public parking lot (if visitors purchase goods at Rodeo Street, they can park here for free) and a parking lot for foreign tourists only (free of charge). Munjeong-dong Rodeo Street is one of Korea’s major shopping streets with customers ranging from teenagers to adults, since discount stores stocking sports wear, casual wear, shoes, men’s and ladies’ suits, and golf wear are all located on this street. Moreover, this is a great place to find deals on famous brands, at prices lower than at a department store. On some items you can get discounts of up to 70-80%. <br><br>
<b>Shopping Tips</b>
<li>Since most of the goods are stock from previous seasons, it might be better to purchase the more classic styles rather than the trendy fashions. In some cases, the goods might have been slightly crumpled or stained during the transfer from warehouse storage, but taking them to the dry-cleaners should fix most problems. However you should be careful when looking at the sewing quality, and check for missing buttons.<br>
<li>One more thing to bear in mind is the shopping season. Even discount stores have periods when stock runs low. The best time to shop is immediately after the stores in Rodeo Street restock their merchandise. This is done at about the same time as department stores.  There is also an enormous variety of goods to choose from during the Rodeo Festivals in May and September. The purchased goods are exchangeable but non-refundable, so check the quality of the products carefully before you purchase them.<br><br>
<li>In addition, Munjeong-dong Rodeo Street has a wide selection of restaurants and entertainment facilities. There are a number of pizza places, coffee shops, and food courts, as well as internet cafes and game rooms in the alleys behind the stores. Visitors can also relax in the surrounding parks.  There’s a park with a 600-year-old zelkova tree right behind the Munjeong 1-dong Resident Center. 
Munjeong Rodeo Street is not just a shopping area; it’s a cultural area. The ‘Munjeong-dong Cultural Festival’ takes place every year in May, and the ‘Munjeong-dong Rodeo Festival’ takes place in May every other year. During these festivals, visitors can watch traditional Korean performances, traditional wedding ceremonies, international fashion parades, hip-hop dancing, and more. 
A charity sale is held on weekends and national holidays on the open-air stage of the Munjeong 1-dong Resident Center, and merchandise is sold for even bigger discounts.|18|+82-2-400-1633|Munjeong-dong Rodeo Street (문정동 로데오거리)|05805|A04|A04|A0401|A04010600|

<br><br>The Seoul Folk Flea Market originated from the flea market in Hwanghak-dong where many street shops and vendors gathered around Cheonggyecheon Stream before it was restored and modernized into its current state. The market was relocated to the Dongdaemun History & Culture Park (Formerly Dongdaemun Stadium) while the Cheonggyecheon Stream was undergoing restorations, and was moved back to Cheonggyecheon Stream sometime later. Seoul City aims to market Seoul Folk Flea Market as a new shopping spot at its current location, the former site of Sungin Girls' Middle School on Cheonggyeo 8-ga Street, near Cheonggyeocheon Stream to develop the Korean representative folk flea market-related tourism industry.
 
<br><br>The main items of the Seoul Folk Flea Market include a diverse range of folk items, traditional crafts, local specialties and fashion items. You may also enjoy a range of foods and snacks including traditional Korean food and fusion cuisine from all over the world. What is special about the market is that you can find rare goods and authentic traditional items that cannot be found at other markets. The market atmosphere is a mix of old, revered traditions and modern aspects, providing visitors with a great shopping experience.

With the construction of the Yeongdong Expressway, the market transitioned from a wholesale focus to individual purchasers. The market naturally developed a food street with many restaurants opening up in the vicinity of each other.<br><br>
The market was losing business with the increase in supermarkets in the area and the ease of internet shopping. To combat this, the market opened an art market in 2013 and was designated as a cultural market in 2015. The second floor of the market houses the Maze Art Market, with twisting pathways lined with small design shops and restaurants. The flea market, held during the second weekend of every month, is not to be missed.|9|+82-33-743-2570|Wonju Jungang Market (원주 중앙시장)|26428|A04|A04|A0401|A04010200|

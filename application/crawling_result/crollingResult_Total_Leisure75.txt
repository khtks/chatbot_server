Along with Hallasan, the oreums were officially named the Hallasan Natural Protection Area (Natural Monument No.12) in 1966.<br><br>

There are six hiking trails along Hallasan. Seongpanak Trail on the east and Gwaneumsa Trail in the north go all the way up to the summit (Baekrokdam). Those looking for a less rigorous hike are advised to take the shorter trails reaching midway up the mountain. All trails are relatively short (less than 10 kilometers) and can be hiked in less than a day. Visitors are advised, however, to start early in the morning if planning on hiking up to the summit and to check official operating hours, as some trails are only open during certain hours of the day. Keep reading for information on some of the most popular trails.<br><br>

* Gwaneumsa Trail (North)—Summit Trail<br>
Gwaneumsa Trail offers hikers the best view of Hallasan’s deep valleys and stunning terrain. Midway along the trail is Guringul (a lava cave) and Tamna Valley. Tamna Valley is especially beautiful during the fall when the leaves are changing and during the winter when the entire area lays under a dusting of snow. <br><br>

* Seongpanak Trail (East)—Summit Trail<br>
This relatively long, gently sloping trail is perfect for beginners. Lush broadleaf trees give shade from the beating sun and in spring the azaleas bloom and turn the mountainside into a dazzling array of color.<br><br>

* Eorimok Trail (Northwest)<br>
This short trail is another relatively easy trail for beginners. In spring, the nearby meadows are adorned with red royal azaleas. From the stone pathway to Mansedongsan visitors can catch a breathtaking panoramic view of the countryside and the island’s signature Oreums. <br><br>

* Yeongsil Trail (Southwest)<br>
As the shortest trail in Hallasan, this trail boasts Yeongsilgiam (a spectacular cliff with series of unusual rock formations). It is covered with azaleas and royal azaleas in spring and vibrant autumn foliage starting in October. <br><br>|4|+82-64-713-9950|Hallasan Mountain Trekking (한라산 트레킹)|63077|A03|A03|A0302|A03022700|

Naerincheon Stream in particular is considered one of the top three rafting spots in Korea along with the Hantangang River and Donggang River. Consisting of over ten rapid sub-streams, Naerincheon is the only stream in Korea that runs from south to north.<br><br>

The stream stretches over 6km from Wondaegyo to Gosari Resting Spot; its narrow x_width and pointed rocks offer one of the most exciting and challenging rafting experiences. Rafts are often turned upside down, and each sub-stream is connected to the others, offering little time for rafters to make each maneuver. <br><br>

Naerincheon Stream Rafting is also known for its excellent amenities, like its modern shower facilities with warm water.<br><br>|10|No tel|Naerincheon Stream Rafting (내린천 래프팅)|24640|A03|A03|A0303|A03030800|

To improve the ambience of the town, Donghae Cultural Center applied for a project named ‘Mukho Deungdae Damhwa’ to the Ministry of Culture, Sports, & Tourism. In August 2010, the center started visiting older people living in Nongol Village to find out their life story and then painted their stories on the walls throughout the village’s alley. Members who majored in art made the sketches and the elderly in their 60-70's colored the sketches to create the mural street of Nongol Village.

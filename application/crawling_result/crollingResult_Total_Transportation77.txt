It is about 19.4 km away from Jengsoen-eup, and is the meeting place of two streams, the Songcheon stream from Gujeolli and Imgyemyeon’s Goljicheon 
stream, which flows down from Samcheok’s Jungbongsan. 
<br><br>The name of the station, Auraji, comes from the verb <i>eoureuda</i>, meaning “be in harmony” in Korean. 
Auraji Station was once named after the region, Yeoryang, but was changed to Auraji, which describes the 
unique geographical features of the village. The area where the two streams meet and become a river became a bustling business zone in the past, where rafts were 
floated with lumber all the way to Seoul.  
<br><br>It is quite a sight looking at the beautiful scenery enveloped by the crystal clear water and pebbles on the riverside surrounded by Nuchusan, Sangwonsan, Okgapsan, Goyangsan, Ballonsan, and the Wangjaesan Mountains.  
At the confluence of these two streams, a statue of Virgin Auraji and a newly built pavilion rest on a hill in the middle of the peaceful landscape. There are also rail bikes being operated at this station, which run 7.2 km from Gujeolli Station to Auraji Station.<br> 
<br>Notably, this is the birthplace of Jeongseon Arirang – Aejeongpyeon. <br>Legend has it that there was a girl and a boy who were deeply in love in this village. The girl lived in Yeoryang and the boy in Gageum, with the Auraji Valley sitting in the middle. One day they were going to pick some camellia flowers in Ssarigol Valley. However, torrential downpours from the night before made the river overflow, making it impossible to use the raft to see each other.
Their heart was aching for they couldn’t see each other. The lyrics of the traditional song Arirang were inspired by this story: 
  
<br><br>“Rower in Auraji, listen to me, please let me cross the river.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful camellia petals in Ssarigol Valley are scattered around. 
 <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The beautiful camellia shed its petals and piled up with dead leaves. 
<br> I miss my dearest one all year around and my heart aches.”  


<br><br>The old rafts still remain in Gageum Village (also known as Gagumi) and Yeoryang village. <br>
A camp site of about 2,000 square meters is open in the months of July and August each year. Many tourist sites are nearby, such as Ojangpokpo Waterfall, Hanggolgyegok Valley, Hwaamdonggul Cave, Hwaamyaksuteo Mineral Spring and others. <br><br>Intercity buses operate from Jeongseon, Yeoryang and on to Gujeolli. From April to November, trains run from Cheongnyangni Station to Jeongseon station  on days ending with the number 2 and 7 (ie. 2, 7, 12, 17).|11|No tel|Auraji Station (아우라지역)|26106|B01|B01|B0102|B01020200|

The station is located in Songwol-dong, Naju-si in South Jeolla Province. The old Naju Station located in Jungnim-dong was the starting point of the Gwangju Student Independence Movement in 1929 that began as a result of the conflicts between Korean and Japanese students who used to commute to Gwangju by train. This historically significant event had delayed the relocation of Naju Station. With the partial opening of the two-track Honam line on July 10, 2001, Naju Station was integrated with Yeongsanpo Station and moved to its current location in front of Naju City Hall. The facilities at the old Naju Station had been too old and the station building too small to sufficiently accommodate the number of passengers in the region, so it was the Yeongsanpo Station that used to cover the passenger demand. After the integration of the two stations, all regular trains on Honam Line, as well as some of the high-speed KTX trains stop at Naju Station.|6|No tel|Naju Station (나주역)|58261|B01|B01|B0102|B01020200|

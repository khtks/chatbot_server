It is also a symbol of time-honored tradition to the extent that the name Andong reminds people of traditional Korean hanok houses. Isangru, an ancient hanok house with a history of 2,590 years, located in the foothills of Mt. Cheondeungsan, served as a venue for the memorial rite for Kim Seon-pyeong, the progenitor of the Andong Kim clan and a meritorious government official during the reign of King Taejo of the Goryeo Dynasty. 
Isangru, meaning ‘a tall majestic building built on frosty ground’, is a two-story wooden building with a tiled roof characterized by elegant curves that form a half-hipped shape when viewed from the side. 
The house consists of two accommodations, Taejangtaesa and Isangru, arranged in a ‘ㅁ’ shape. The large door located in the middle of the ground floor offers an open view of the beautiful natural environment including a pine grove, a pond, and wild flowers. 
Built in 1750, this hanok house shows its age in its wooden pillars, stone walls, and interiors decorated with wooden engraving on the handrail. Guests can stay in a room heated with wood in winter, or in a tent for a different experience in summer. The house has been well maintained with various repair works, and underwent extensive renovations, including the wallpaper and floors, in 2013. 
Although it is close to a road, the house is surrounded by old trees, creating the impression that it is situated in the middle of a dense forest. A path runs between ancient pine trees on the road leading to the house. There is a pond with water lilies and white lotus flowers in front of the house, while various species of wild flowers including big blue lily turf, plantain lily, montane aster, and asters come into full bloom around the house in their respective seasons. 
Fully maintained by the Andong Kim clan, Isangru is a large structure that can accommodate many people and is used to hold clan assemblies. This tall building is also used as a venue for concerts, seminars and traditional hands-on experience programs for students, including tea ceremony, masked dance, natural dyeing, hanji (Korean paper) crafts, and filial duty education programs. The house also offers guests a traditional nobleman’s dining table including various wild vegetable dishes for breakfast. 
Isangru is popular among Korean and foreign guests who want to experience traditional Korean culture or enjoy a relaxing stay with their parents amid beautiful nature. In addition, it is located between Hahoe Folk Village and Dosanseowon Confucian Academy in Andong, and offers easy access to other nearby tourist attractions including Bongjeongsa Temple, which is the oldest wooden building in Korea and is just three minutes’ drive away, and the two-hour-long Dulegil Trail.|11|+82-54-843-3328 / +82-10-3522-1542|Andong Gotaek Isangru (Taejangtaesa of the Andong Kim Clan) [Korea Quality] / 안동고택 이상루 [한국관광 품질인증]|36616|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Located in Sawol-ri, Namsan-myeon, a place known for its beautiful sandy beach, the guesthouse ‘Beautiful Life’ was built by architect Kim Gyeong-ho, and is composed of 100-year-old-hanok buildings and a courtyard with a large sophora. Designed to provide guests with a “beautiful life”, it provides both accommodation services and diverse cultural programs including exhibitions, performances, and movie screenings. 
Beautiful Life was conceived as a cultural tourism space set amid quiet countryside where guests can relax by enjoying exhibitions and performances, reading a book, listening to music, or getting lost in thought amid the serene atmosphere of the house. The owner transformed the abandoned house into a beautiful hanok stay after falling under the charm of the quiet location and the old house with its beautiful old tree and well.

The guestrooms include Jewoldang, Yeorakdang, Uiyeoldang, and Heosimjeong. The first of these is a 100-year-old hanok structure with a tiled roof, which can be rented in its entirety. Its name, Jewoldang, roughly means “a place to pick up the moon” because the moon is visible above the sephora in the courtyard from the daecheong (wooden floor) on bright moonlit nights.  Its ‘ㅡ’-shaped structure and ceiling rafters are original features of the old hanok, while the kitchen and bathroom were entirely renovated, as was the attic on the second floor, lending a special atmosphere to the house. 
As for the Yeorakdang, which means ‘a house to enjoy together,’ it was converted from a storeroom for apples into a building that can accommodate groups of guests and also screen movies. The Uiyeoldang, meaning ‘a house to discuss and study together,’ was built by transforming the haengrangchae (servants’ quarters) and the stable into a reading space and a seminar room, respectively. Finally, the Heosimjeong, meaning ‘a pavilion where one can empty one’s mind’, is the ideal place for relaxing in small groups. Each of these four buildings is built in a modern style with wooden materials, glass windows, and staircases. There is also an outdoor stage equipped with a sound system for special performances.

Located in Bonghwa-eup, Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Bonghwa Namho Gutaek is an old house from the Chosun period designated as Cultural Property Material No. 385. It was built by Nongsan Kim Nam Yeong in 1876 and his son Namho Kim Roe Sik had lived there.

The spirit of putting others and his country before himself continues until now. Having been built with high-quality materials, the 140-year old Namho Gutaek has barely suffered any deformation. In addition, attentive care added by the descendants has kept the traditional beauty of the hanok intact. One may even feel reverence at the Sosel Daemun (gate). In harmony with the hanok, the garden in the yard and the flower bed sitting next to the wall change color as season changes. It is a great place to feel the scent of old trees and get some rest. In 2016, the shared toilet was renovated in modern style to alleviate any inconvenience for the guests.

The beginning of Buyongheon is deeply related with Jeonju Hyanggyo. In around 1935, the local bureaucrats lived around the Hyanggyo after building 12 houses one after another. Most of them came from rich families. These collective houses were called Buyong Houses, which meant rich houses. The name Buyongheon originated from Buyong Houses. The rooms of Buyongheon are composed of Toenmaru Bang, Daecheong Maru Bang, Large Daecheong Maru Bang and Big Sarangchae. The interior of the rooms looks neat with the beauty of blank space as they excluded unnecessary decorations. Carefully prepared breakfast is served upon request made in advance. Visitors can also experience traditional culture such as traditional etiquette education and Korean paper art. 
In fall, the yellow leaves of the ginkgo tree in the garden of Jeonju Hyanggyo lights up the roof of Buyongheon. It is recommendable to walk along the Jeonjucheon Stream and take pictures of the colorful murals and the cafes in the Jaman Mural Village located on the left sie of the Hanok Village. It takes 15 minutes from Jeonju Station and 10 minutes from Jeonjuu Express Bus Terminal to Buyongheon by taxi.

Cheonggong Hanok is a mere 10 minutes away from Bulguksa Station (Donghae Line) on foot. The two traditional Hanok buildings house 10 rooms. Once you enter the main gate, the harmonious scene of a big grassy yard, a very old pine tree, a small pond, and the graceful Hanok buildings welcomes you. The garden looks a bit exotic, but there is a back story to it. The first architect of the house did business in Japan with his wife living alone in Gyeongju but regretted not having spent a long time with her; thus, he came back to Korea, built the biggest house possible, and lived with his wife for the rest of his life. Afterward, his descendants took over it, named it after the architect, Cheonggong, and opened it as a Hanok stay. That is how the space where Korea’s traditional Hanok and Japanese garden were put together by the Korean architect who did an extended stint in Japan came to be. The table used by the couple is preserved in the garden for guests to look at. Although it is a traditional Hanok, every room is equipped with a TV, a refrigerator, an air-conditioner, and a bathroom to make the space comfortable to stay even for children.

The owner discovered this geomantically ideal site, with a mountain to its rear and a river to its front, and constructed a 238m2 hanok on a 1,778m2 plot of land. The hanok is a ‘ㄱ’-shaped structure consisting of two floors above ground, with the guest accommodation situated on the first floor. The pension was named ‘Cheonnyeon Hanok’ to represent the owner’s wish that the house be preserved for over a thousand years (“cheon nyeon”). It is set amid a beautiful landscape and commands an open view of the nearby pine grove, a large pond, fields, and Tohamsan Mountain.  The house is built of pine wood and red clay, and features an eco-friendly geothermal floor heating system and double-layered doors to keep out drafts. Although the outer yard is covered with gravel, the spacious grassy inner courtyard of the bonchae building is equipped with benches, and serves as both a playground for children and a relaxing space for adult guests. The garden is notable for its well-tended flowers and trees.  The pension has 6 guestrooms including four single rooms (23m2); one room (29m2) with a numaru (upper floor) that can accommodate 3 to 5 people; and a two-room (46m2) suite that can accommodate 4 to 10 people. Maehwa-bang (single room) is characterized by rafters and a ‘井’-framed ceiling; Mogryeon-bang (two rooms) is a large guestroom that can accommodate two to three families, and has a sliding door in the middle for convenient use of the space; and Yeonggot-bang has an upper floor equipped with a BBQ facility. Large family groups tend to rent the Yeonggot-bang and an additional room. Other guests can also use the separate BBQ site in the courtyard. (Grill and charcoal: KRW 15,000 per 4 persons)  Each room has a pleasant, clean interior and is equipped with a TV, fridge, air-conditioner, bathroom, sink, electric rice cooker, kettle, induction plaque, and Internet.

The head of the art center, potter Kim Ho, originally ran a cultural life school for residents in Pocheon, but he settled at the foot of Chungnyeongsan Mountain in Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province after the school was severely damaged by a huge flood in 1997. Kim established the center as a space to support the cultural and leisure activities of local residents and the creative activities of talented youth and artists. It took four years to build and comprises a gallery, seminar room, hanok accommodation, Korean restaurant, etc. 
The center attracts various types of guests including people who appreciate the beauty of hanok and the local landscape, family visitors, company groups, and couples among others. The overall structure of the center is very distinguished, and consists of three levels resembling staircases: the first level contains a Korean restaurant, the second level has a lecture room with a capacity of 60 persons, as well as a gallery with a pond and a pavilion set in a Korean garden; and the third level has guestrooms furnished with a toenmaru (a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the building) and ondol floor heating, as well as a tall gate, a wide front yard, and tearoom. Although it was only built just over ten years ago, visitors say that it seems like an old hanok house because of the unvarnished roof tiles and the surrounding stonewall, which was built in the traditional dry-stone method using only local stones. 
The center offers diverse experience programs including tea ceremony, natural dyeing, mask, rice cake, and bean curd making programs, as well as a boudoir handicraft program. Its “prestige” program is the advanced tea ceremony class in which the head of the center teaches participants how to brew tea according to traditional etiquette, etc. As the Chi-ong Art Center has no TV or Internet, visitors have an opportunity to empty their heads and relax amid the serene environment, appreciate nature, take a walk in the garden or simply read a book.|1|+82-10-4703-3668|Chi-ong Art Center [Korea Quality] / 취옹예술관 [한국관광 품질인증]|12448|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

This house was originally located in Wonchon-ri, Dosan-myeon but was relocated to its current location in 1976 after a flood caused by the collapse of Andong Dam. Chiam Old House consists of 22 rooms, 5 gates, and 1 detached building. The main building is taller than the detached building. One of the unique features of this detached building is that it has both gable roof and gambrel roof on either side. Listed as Gyeongsangbuk-do Folklore Material No. 11, Chiam Old House now serves as a guesthouse for those wishing to experience an old traditional Korean house. The rooms that are open to guests are “Seongmyeongjae,” “Gyeongeopjae,” and “Nakseongdang.” The large room called “Bakkatchae,” or outer building, is the most comfortable one to stay in for a night, since it's furnished with kitchen, TV, air conditioner, and bathroom. “Seongmyeongjae” means “honesty and integrity” in Korean. It’s an “ondol (Korean floor heating system)” room typical of any traditional Korean house, where you have to sleep on the floor. "Gyeongeopjae" is the most popular one among the guests, and its name means “unselfish and reverent.” The rooms next to the gate called “Ilgeonjae,” “Seokcheonjae,” and “Hakgujae” located along the wall are great places to stay if you want to see the surroundings and the old house at the same time. “Jamnyongdang” on the east side of the main building is named after the small pond in the yard, and it means “to strive to be a man of virtue like the dragon flying in the sky.” There are lots of beautiful flowers in the small garden in complete harmony with the old house and surrounding mountains, making it a great place to take a leisurely walk as you experience the history.|11|+82-54-858-4411, +82-10-3530-4413|Chiam Old House [Korea Quality] / 치암고택 [한국관광 품질인증]|36679|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Chunujaegotaek is an architectural house from the late Joseon period built by Gwon Jin (1568 - 1620). He was the grandson of Gwon Ui, the 10th generation of Gwon Su Hong who, in turn, is the founder of Bokyagongpa. Chunu is the name of Chunu Gwongjin which means “spring rain comes.” Is it because of the name? When rain drops fall on the Chunujae house, the fragrance of the hanok becomes more evident. In the yard are different fruit trees, peepal trees, and chrysanthemums. In particular, the chrysanthemums planted in front of the stone wall are natives to Korea and have witnessed the history of the house. Every year, the chrysanthemum petals are collected for tea brewing and the branches are soaked to make alcohol. A small stream runs outside the house, which makes for a pleasant sound. Staying in the hanok makes life elegant, restful, and idyllic. Currently, Gwon Chang Yong and his wife, the heir of the family, are living in the main room of the main building, maintaining the house. Unwilling to send off guests without meals, they provide breakfast. There are seven rooms in total but accommodation is only allowed on 2-3 floors in summer. Traditional Korean paste making experience is also conducted by Mrs. Gwon. A group of 10 or more is required to make a reservation in advance. Experience program varies depending on the season.

The rose arch at the entrance also serves as a nice background for photos during the season when rose blooms. Rooms are all floor-heated (Ondol) and display the unique gracefulness of hanok with exposed rafters on the roof.

The ‘Dals Garden’ is a modern facility grafted on a traditional Korean style house. The old but graceful walls with the garden beyond them welcome the guests first. Entering the house, various flower plants and a wide grass garden add to the excitement of travelers. The Toenmaru (a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the room), pillars and tiles of the neat and well-constructed Korean style house, shine as if they are wiped with oil every day. The peak of Mt. Gayasan beyond the house looks like a picture at a glance. The Moon Garden has 10 rooms in total. Among them, 2 Special Rooms are a little wider than ordinary rooms and equipped with a sink. Though cooking in the room is not allowed, simple food and beverage can be consumed if they are cleaned well afterwards. The room with a single bed is good for a solo traveler or a foreigner who is not accustomed to sleeping in an Ondol room. It takes only 3 minutes to go to Haeinsa Intercity Bus Stop. It is required, however, to pay the admission fee to Haeinsa Temple and the parking fee in addition to the room rates because the house is located on the way to Haeinsa Temple. It is recommended to enjoy walking around the Haeinsa Temple early in the next morning or going up to nearby peaks such as Mt. Maehwasan or Namsan Cheil Peak.

Danchon Seowon Gotaek is an old Hanok sitting in harmony with beautiful mountains, fields, and valleys of Danyang. Once entering the high gate, there are Daffodil Room and Red Clay Room on the right, and Woodland Peony Room and Apricot Flower Room on the left. In the rather big main building are Peony Room, Cotton Room, and White Dandelion Room. A picturesque pavilion stands impressively next to the main building. The living room of the Peony Room is equipped with antique furniture and pictures, whereas there are rafters, big beams, and wooden floor in the living room of White Dandelion Room. Daffodil Room and Apricot Flower Room also boast of traditional rafters and beams. Since Daffodil Room and Red Clay Room are small, they share kitchen and bathroom, and the rates are more affordable. The cafe in the corner of the yard, with thousands of vinyls and players collected by the owner, is a good place to listen to music, or have a cup of coffee or tea.
It is also refreshing to have a walk along the path beside the spring running in front of a big old tree. At night on clear weather, you can enjoy a starry sky. It takes about 20 minutes car by from the accommodation to Danyang Gugyeong Market, and 8 minutes to Suyang Gaebit Tunnel.

Beginning of brightness that is what Hanok Guesthouse Dankyung means. The name reflects the politeness and consideration of the people of Jeonju. It also carries the wish for the guests of the guesthouse to become polite and considerate as well. 
Since it was built in June 1943, Dankyung has kept its original form intact through the turbulent period of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonization, Korean War, and modernization. Despite the traditional form, the approximately 70-year-old Hanok is convenient to use and is beautiful in shape, emitting its beauty and gracefulness to the visitors of Jeonju Hanok Village. Anyone staying in Dankyung will feel as if he/she has become a noble man/woman of old Korea.
The white birch garden at the entrance, maple tree, and apricot flower tree in the yard create a seasonal atmosphere. Dansil, Hyangsil, and Gyeongsil of the main building and Byeolsil and Dasil of the separate building are equipped with a wooden floor, giving off a delicate wood scent. The gallery opposite the garden displays artworks and provides a space for guests to have breakfast or drink coffee or tea.

The Deokdongdaek House of the Gaesil Village Farming Association Corporation is an elegant hanok building with a grassy courtyard and a charming atmosphere. This ‘一’-shaped hanok consists of two rooms – the Maesil Room for 2 to 3 people, and the Juksil Room for 3 to 5 people. Each room is decorated with refined hanji wallpaper (Hanji is a traditional Korean paper handmade from the mulberry tree) and equipped with a range of amenities including TV, fridge, air-conditioner, Internet, and toiletries. The Juksil Room is also equipped with cooking facilities, and guests can have a BBQ party in the large courtyard. 
Known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan, Gaesil Village was founded by the descendants of Kim Jong-jik (pen-name: Jeompiljae, 1431-1492), a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar of the early Joseon period who died during the Literati Purge of 1498. The head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62) and Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage Material No. 111), the old village school, are also situated in the village. In addition, the nearby Daegaya Museum displays the writing accessories of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 209). 
The village is also known as Gaehwasil, meaning “a beautiful valley with blooming flowers” as it is surrounded by a flower-covered mountain called Mt. Hwagaesan, a 350-year-old bamboo forest, and Jeopmubong Peak, which is said to resemble a fluttering butterfly. Over 80% of the village houses are traditional hanok buildings nestled amid a cozy environment. 
During the Campaign to Create Beautiful Communities conducted in 2001 and the Farm Experience Village Development Project in 2005, the village’s hanok were renovated or entirely rebuilt, earthen-stone walls were built, walking paths created, and refined landscaping works carried out, establishing the village in its current form. Furthermore, a village shelter, experience center, Internet café, and other facilities were built for the convenience of residents and visitors alike. In recognition of the villager’ efforts to revitalize their community, Gaesil was awarded the presidential citation at the Korea Rural Village Awards in 2011. 
Designated as a NongHyup’s Farm Stay Village in 2003, Gaesil operates a wide variety of hands-on experience programs relating to nature, agriculture, and local traditions, such as collecting sweet potatoes and rice planting; Korean traditional etiquette and tea ceremony; kite making and straw handicrafts; traditional food experiences such as yeot (Korean hard taffy) and yugwa (deep-fried sweet rice cakes); traditional games such as riding on a swing and neolttwigi (Korean see-saw); as well as loach fishing, ice sledding and so on. Gaesil Village, a representative farm stay village that “blooms” in every season, attracts around 50-60,000 visitors every year.

The Lecture Hall building is built upon a stone pedestal and has an expansive hall with a great view over the Naeseongcheon Stream. Breathing in the clear air of Yecheon brings one back to the days when the lecture hall rang out with the discussions of the scholars. With a floor area of about 100㎡, there are three rooms in total, making the unit an optimal choice for workshops and other group trips. The most exclusive and beautiful room is the Euphojeong Pavilion, built upon a cliff overlooking the Naeseongcheon Stream. It was the place reserved for guests of the academy, and it is also the best place in the complex to hear the sounds of water rushing down the stream below the cliff. Dongjae and Seojae units include a bathroom, but guests staying in the Euphojeong Pavilion and the Lecture Hall must use a public bathroom outside the building. Ipdeokru Pavilion, which functioned as something akin to the gate to the entire complex, is a seminar room which can host up to 30 people. Standing on the 2nd floor of the pavilion brings one to the view of the Naeseongcheon Stream flowing in an arc around the mountain. Outdoor barbecue grills are located to the back of the Dongjae and Seojae units. <br><br>
Yecheon is a city brimming with scenic sights and historic heritages. Choganjeong Pavilion, the filming site of the K-drama Mr. Sunshine, is located 30 minutes away by car. Other sights like Hoeryongpo Meandering Stream, Geumdangsil Traditional Village, and Yongmunsa Temple are located 30 minutes by car.

Hanok Hotel Dongrakwon used to be a memorial hall for Missionary M. Junkin who worked in Jeonju in 1985, and had long been used as an official residence for the Bank of Korea. The 100-year-old Hanok retains the history and culture that modern hotels do not have. Since the renovation to make it a hanok hotel, it is now utilized as a space for traditional music performances, traditional weddings, or small weddings. The entire building can be rented for various gatherings, seminars, conferences, family events, and so on. The beauty of a hanok is found in every corner of Dongrakwon such as the wide lawn, the pond in front of Sarangchae, and the jar stand next to Anchae. The antique furniture and folding screen in the rooms have been used for generations, enabling guests of the hanok to time travel to 50-100 years ago.
The yard is a great place to play simple Korean traditional plays such as Jegichagi and Dakjichiji, whereas the free-of-charge red clay sauna will relieve fatigue. The outdoor hot / cold bath and sun bath site is a new addition to Dongrakwon.
There is a 600-year-old Ginkgo tree standing on the Eunhang-ro, where the accommodation is located. Opposite the alley is Donghak Revolution Memorial Exhibition Hall; Gyeonggijeon East Gate is 200m away. The hotel is close to Taejo-ro, the busiest street of Jeonju Hanok Village; neighboring Eunhang-ro, Choi Myeong Hee-gil, and Eojin-gil all retain the unique quietness and beauty of Hanok Village. It will be also nice to ride on the mountain bike that Dongrakwon offers free of charge in order for guests to visit corners of the Hanok Village, or ride along the Jeonjucheon Stream.

Some will think that the climate here is not suitable for farming, but the apples grown here are considered some of the best in the country. This mountain village is very strange since the ice doesn't melt even during hot summer days, and it's warm during winter. Eoreumgol Hanok Pension is in “Samyang-ri,"(Samyang Village) which refers to all three villages named "Sangyang," "Jungyang," and "Hayang," all located on the skirt of the mountain. All the villagers say that it's healthy to live and cultivate a farm in a high region. While apples in most other farming areas fall due to stress during hot summer days, it’s not the case in this village, thanks to the cold air from the rock crevices. Because the apples hang on the trees longer, they are harvested about a month later than those in other parts of the country and are much sweeter as well. People living here don't even turn on the air conditioner during summer, because all they have to do is throw open the doors.
It’s not hard to find Eoreumgol Hanok Pension in Samyang Village because there is an apple orchard right in front of it. The pension consists of two traditional Korean houses surrounded by low stone walls. The one in the front is for the guests to stay, and the other one at the back is where the couple who own the pension live. Both houses are carefully built by using the same materials and technique. The thing only that sets them apart is the roof -- the guesthouse has a gabled roof, whereas the residential house has a gambrel roof. All the columns, rafters, and other building materials are pinewood from Gangwon-do. The wooden floor is coated with sesame oil, and the walls are made of red clay mixed with seaweed water. The houses were built in 2007, and the guesthouse opened in June of the same year.
Because the house is built only with all-natural, chemical-free materials, it smells good, and the level of humidity is just right throughout the seasons because both wood and red clay serve as natural dehumidifier and humidifier.
One of the best features of this traditional Korean house is probably the natural environment of a high-altitude region, where you can see the mountain peaks and clouds hanging over them. Most of the houses in the village are single-story like this pension, which has two guestrooms: one floor-heated room for couples and a large one for a group. The larger room commands a great view of the peak of Cheonwangsan Mountain on the right, Baegunsan Mountain on the left, and Unmunsan Mountain in the back. All the windows and doors in this guestroom are made big for the guests to have a better view of the mountains. The pension offers a farm experience program where guests can pick chestnuts right behind the pension and apples from the Eoreumgol Apple Orchard in the middle of November.

The house was named ‘Eoryeondang,’ meaning a “house abounding with beautiful words,” after Eoryeoncheon Stream (previously Dongcheon Stream).’ This two-story hanok building was built with granite construction materials including the staircases, fence, and external pillars, creating a solid and majestic impression. 
Located next to the house is Sanjeonsaem Spring, which was found over 400 years ago and used to supply the house with drinking water, but it was transformed into a garden after the spring ran dry.
Eoryeondang has seven guestrooms all together, including three rooms (26m2) equipped with a sink, another three rooms (26m2 each) without a sink, and one room (about 39㎡) equipped with a maru (wooden floor). 
In particular, the large room, Eoryeonjae, is recommended for family guests. Six of the rooms - Yi, Ho, Ye, Byeong, Hyeong and Gong - were named after administrative agencies of the Joseon Dynasty. Each room can accommodate from 4 to 6 people and is equipped with a bathroom, TV, air-conditioner, refrigerator, Wi-Fi, etc. 
Set amid an attractive natural environment including pine and bamboo trees, the house is characterized by its interesting ceilings, including the ‘井’-shaped ceiling on the first floor, and the exposed rafters on the second floor. The house is mainly built of pine wood, and each room is decorated with a traditional style of floor paper using beans and hanji (traditional Korean paper handmade from mulberry tree) wallpaper.
The house is adjacent to various interesting sites including the Military Headquarters of Gyeongsangjwa-do Province (Historic Site No. 320), where the military governor of Gyeongsangjwa-do used to stay; an elliptical fortress built in 1417, with a circumference of 1.2km and walls about 3.7meters high; Oesol Memorial Hall, which is a Hangeul museum; and Dongcheon Water Park. It also offers guests the opportunity to play various folk games including yut (a Korean traditional board game), tuho (stick throwing), jegichagi (Korean shuttlecock game). The house makes continuous efforts to improve its services by surveying its guests and reflecting their opinions accordingly.|1|+82-52-297-5796|Eoryeondang [Korea Quality] / 어련당 [한국관광 품질인증]|44488|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Based on Ojukheon, the birthplace of Yi I (one of the two most eminent Korean Confucian scholars of the Joseon Dynasty), it was built to spread the ideas of Yi I and promote the excellent features of the Korean hanok to the world through a variety of traditional cultural experience programs. The village is situated next to Ojukheon House, where Yi I and his mother Shin Saimdang were born. It is also near Gyeongpo Lake, one of the most famous tourist attractions in Gangneung, and is only 1.8km away from Gangneung Olympic Park, which served as the ice sports venue of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.

Seongyojang House was built by Yi Nae-beon (pen-name: Mugyeong), an 11th-generation descendant of Grand Prince Hyoryeong (the elder brother of King Sejong the Great), and has been repaired and extended numerous times over the last ten generations. 
The house is composed of a variety of rooms and buildings of different sizes, and there are twelve gates between its many buildings, which include 3 ‘Byeoldang’ rooms (Dong, Seo, and Oe), Sarangchae, Jungsarang, Haengangchae, and Sadang. 
Seongyojang House is well known as one of the largest and greatest houses in Korea in terms of the number and size of its buildings and its total land area among houses built at that time. Interestingly, Seongyojang was built to such a great size due to the influence of the classical poem Gwandongbyeolgok (about the Beautiful Scenery of Gwandong, present-day Gangwon-do, in 1580) written by Jeong Cheol (1536-1593, pen-name: Songgang). Because of the popularity of this poem, a cultural trend emerged in which noblemen of the late Joseon Dynasty felt compelled to visit the Gwandong (present-day Gangwon-do) area at least once in their lifetime, and Seongyojang was a must-see attraction. 
The house experienced a crisis when only three people were staying in this vast building. However, the director of the house, Lee Kang-baek, strived to save his ancestors’ invaluable heritage and finally received the necessary administrative support. Thanks to that, all the toilets and shower facilities were modernized, and Seongyojang House now offers both the beauty of a traditional hanok building and convenient modern facilities for all its guests. 
Seongyojang has many wonderful structures including Hwallaejeong Pavilion, one of its most charming structures; Yeolhwadang, which was given as a gift to the Russian Consulate; Yeonjidang, which was built in an elegant style; and Seobyeoldang. In particular, the signboard of Hwallaejeong was changed and rewritten regularly by members of the Joseon literati who stayed in the house. The most famous version of the signboard was written by Gim Jeong-hui (1786-1856, pen-name: Chusa).

Situated in Hahoe, which is partially enclosed by the Nakdonggang River, Garam Choyeonjae stands out among the village’s many hanok houses due to its beautiful thatched roof. The village has become a popular tourist destination thanks to the distinguished natural landscape along the Nakdonggang River, its 100 ~ 200-year-old hanok houses, and nearby Buyongdae Cliff, which commands a panoramic view of the village. 
The name of the house is a compound word consisting of ‘garam’, which is the pen-name of the house’s owner, a 15th–generation descendant of Ryu Seong-ryong (pen-name: Seoae, 1542-1607, a scholar-official of the Joseon Dynasty), and ‘choyeonjae’, which means “a thatched house in which swallows live.” Guests can even see the swallows and their nests under the rafters and eaves of this simple, cozy hanok. 
The house is also surrounded by various well-known buildings such as Damyeonjae House, the largest and oldest hanok in the village; Yangjindang House (Treasure No. 306); and Binyeonjeongsa House (National Folklore Cultural Heritage No. 86), which was built and used as a library by Ryu Un-yong (pen-name: Gyeomam). 
Garam Choyeonjae consists of two rectangular hanok buildings with clean and well-maintained rooms exuding a traditional and antique atmosphere. In particular, the house’s beautifully maintained thatched roof attracts many foreign visitors. The house also provides various experience programs, including an opportunity to use a treadmill, millstone, and mortar, and a gat-making experience (a gat is a Korean traditional hat made of bamboo and horsehair).

It was originally built in 1942 and remodeled in 2011 as a guesthouse by the current owner. The guesthouse has most of the features of a traditional Korean house still intact, but with modern amenities added for the comfort of the guests. The floor, walls, and ceiling are coated with red clay, and the ceiling rafters are visible as in most traditional Korean houses. Many guests say that sleeping in a room made of these natural materials helps them relieve fatigue. The rooms are well-insulated and warm for the cold winter days.
The guesthouse is close to Gyeonggijeon Shrine, which enshrines a portrait of Taejo Yi Seong-gye, the first king of Joseon, and is conveniently located for those wishing to take a tour of Jeonju Hanok Village featuring hundreds of traditional Korean houses, Omokdae, and Jeondong Catholic Cathedral. In addition to these tourist attractions, there is also a traditional marketplace called Nambu Market with lots to eat and see.
The guesthouse owner named it "Good Day" because he wishes all his guests to have a good day during their stay. He decorated every corner of the guesthouse with this in mind. The grass yard and colorful garden are beautiful throughout the seasons. The garden includes a mix of wild flowers, pine nut trees, fig trees, pomegranate trees, grape vines, and jujube trees. The “toetmaru (open living room with wooden floor)" right in front of the garden is also decorated with small flowerpots. The “toetmaru” is the most popular place among the guests because it’s a great place to enjoy the sun and breathe in the scent of flowers. On a rainy day, you can hear the raindrops falling down the eaves. There are six guestrooms at the guesthouse, named "Spring Waltz,” “Summer Tiffany,” “Autumn Pomegranate,” “Winter Festival”, "Sunshine", and "Welcome." The ceiling rafters are visible in all the rooms as in most of traditional Korean houses. The rooms are furnished with TV, refrigerator, and air conditioner. The bathroom comes with shower booth and bidet.
People of different age groups come to stay at this guesthouse, and most of them say the guesthouse is clean and comfortable to stay in, thanks to the owner who sun-dries the sheets and blankets on the rooftop, cleans the rooms, and cultivates the garden every day of the year to make sure that the guests can have a comfortable, memorable stay.

Originally, the house was a residence of the Andong Branch of the descendants of Gwangsan Kim’s Clan. Note, however, that Gwon Ohchun, head of a Korean traditional culture center, has acquired and remodeled and opened it in May 2010 for the public to experience this old family hanok house. It’s a quiet place where you can enjoy the nature of the Andong area. 
Its "ㅁ"-shaped structure with a courtyard is preserved as its original Hanok structure, but the tiled roof and rectangular stone below the stylobate were newly built. Each connected floor offers access to each room. While preserving the original features of hanok, some elements outside the hanok are new to the house such as the wall between the courtyard of the Anchae and the courtyard of the Sarangchae and a tall gate. The grassy courtyard is decorated with garden rocks and bonsai trees. 
Gudamjeongsa House's structure has a specific feature of having the courtyard, Anchae, Bakkatchae, and backyard all connected in a neat hill. The Bakkatchae has a patio type with high maru (wood floor), where guests can enjoy the scenery and a relaxing time, whereas the Anchae has a main room (Anbang) that used to be a family living space. 
The Anmadang in between the buildings is a square shape with empty ceiling, which helps  circulate air and enhance the light 
access in the space.  
The courtyard, Anchae, and Anmadang situated inside the ㅁ-shaped structure form a triple composition of natural, artificial, and artificial-natural spaces. In general, the hanok house doesn’t have a courtyard covered with grass because it makes the house damp, but this house has one since the rectangular stone below the stylobate has elevated the house. 
Due to its characteristics as a hanok building, i.e., well-ventilated in summer since it has many doors and windows, Gudamjeongsa House has no air conditioner; in winter, however, the rooms are heated by putting wood on the furnace and guests can experience the heated floor of the room with the Korean-style heating system (ondol). 
Gudamjeongsa House provides traditional Korean dining that includes pickled wild greens of Siberian ginseng, mulberry leaves, and dandelion, grilled Andong mackerel, and side dishes without using artificial seasonings, prepared by the owner and loved by guests.

Gurume Resort is where early traditional Korean guesthouses are located. The traditional Korean houses were relocated to this place after a flood. The resort consists of seven traditional Korean houses named "Baksanjeong,” "Cheongongjeong,” "Gamdongjaesa,” "Palhoedangjaesa,” "Gyenam Old House,” "Seounjeong,” and "Chilgok Old House." Built in the 17th century, "Baksanjeong" is the oldest house there, and it has one guestroom. “Cheongongjeong,” “Gamdongjaesa,” and “Palhoejaesa” were built in the 18th century, whereas "Seounjeong,” "Gyenam Old House,” and "Chilgok Old House" were built in the 19th century. For this reason, the traditional Korean houses look slightly different from each other with one thing in common: they were all renovated and equipped with comfortable modern facilities while preserving most of the features of a traditional Korean house. All the guestrooms are furnished with bathroom with shower and air conditioning system. A hi-tech security system is also installed to ensure the safety of the guests. In addition to Gurume Resort, Happy Traditional Village also has a book café housed in a traditional Korean house as well as dining restaurant, experience rooms, and plaza, allowing the visitors to lodge and engage in a wide range of activities.

The House of Kim Gi-hyeon (Gyeam Historic House, National Folklore Cultural Heritage 199) is a hanok with over 100 years of history that was established by renovating a nobleman’s house dating from the nineteenth century and equipping it with modern facilities. The Gyeongju Kim clan has lived in the Seosan area, a fertile stretch of land in the middle of the west coast region, for over 600 years. The house has been open to the public since 2010, and attracts many Korean and foreign guests.

The owner renovated the old house by installing a modern bathroom, sink, kitchen and air-conditioning and filling it with antique furniture, and transformed it into a clean and pleasant tourist accommodation with high-class bedding in order to avoid the stereotype about hanok being uncomfortable. In particular, the kitchen has been transformed into a modern facility where guests can enjoy a cup of tea or a meal. The house is also packed with charming features including a small old well equipped with a pump, a wood-burning stove with an iron pot, and a platform for crocks of sauces and condiments. 

The House of Kim Gi-hyeon is home to the small Wadang (Roof Tile) Museum, which contains a collection of roof tiles ranging from the Goryeo Dynasty to the Joseon Dynasty. The friendly owners also run a ‘Wadang Rubbing Experience’ program that is popular among foreign tourists and students alike, and strive to provide all their guests with comfort and relaxation and share pleasant moments with them.
The house’s courtyard reflects the beauty of each season, including flower blossoms in spring, colorful leaves in autumn, and a snowy landscape in winter.

Yeonghuidang, meaning ‘eternal happiness’, was named with the wish that every day will be a happy day for guests. It consists of two rooms with a communal kitchen, living room and toilets. It has a structure of a traditional hanok building with modern facilities including kitchen and toilets. The kitchen is equipped with a sink, a microwave and other amenities for simple cooking.

Yeonghuidang is connected with other hanok guesthouses, Samhyeongul, Obokheon, and Chilboam, which are operated by the same owner. This complex of hanok guesthouses is linked together, although each guesthouse has a separate entrance, so that it can be used flexibly depending on the number of guests and the purpose of the stay. When these guesthouses were built, as the owner wanted to build them in harmony with the surrounding atmosphere of the area, the complex was constructed as a hanok structure with a low x_height by using Korean red pine wood and by preserving the unique features of the hanok such as pillars, rafters, wooden floors, doors and roof tiles. Its high quality construction materials including pine wood pillars and white hanji (traditional Korean paper handmade from mulberry trees) add a refined atmosphere to the hanok buildings. The scent of pine trees and the yard pebbled with precious stones will help guests to enjoy walking around the guesthouse in the middle of the city.
The guesthouse is also adjacent to various famous tourist attractions including the hot spot of Seochon, Daeho Bookstore, Suseong Valley, Tongin Market, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. Furthermore, walking further along the road, guests will find other popular destinations in Seoul such as Bukchon Hanok Village, Insa-dong, Changdeokgung Palace, and Deoksugung Palace. Yeonghuidang’s staff can speak in Chinese and English and will provide tourist information in detail.

Located in Gyodong, Jeongeup City, Anjinsa Historic House is a hanok structure with more than 200 years of tradition that is surrounded by clean, friendly countryside, green mountains and fields.  Entering by the tall gate, guests will immediately see the hanok with the courtyard and a charming bamboo grove in the background. 
Anjinsa Historic House is composed of four accommodation buildings, namely, the munganchae (gate building), sarangchae (men’s quarters), anchae (women’s quarters) and byeolchae (detached house), and a storeroom. After three years of repair work starting in 2007, the house was renovated as a hanok stay house with convenient interior facilities including modern bathrooms. Both the sarangchae and byeolchae consist of a room and a daecheong (wooden floor) where guests can enjoy drinking a tea or simply relaxing. 
The byeolchae, a pavilion located on a hill behind the house, is a hanok structure with a small toenmaru (the narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the building) and a pond. It has two rooms each equipped with a bathroom and a daecheongmaru (wooden floored room) looking onto a beautiful landscape appreciated for its autumnal scenery in particular. It is recommended to family guests and those who want to enjoy their private time. 
In addition, the bamboo grove is near the pavilion, and there is a 200-year-old sand pear tree behind the anchae which has been designated as a protected tree by Jeongeup City. 
The house has a well-ventilated storeroom - with a wooden floor rather than typical earth floor - where rice used to be kept. The storeroom is now used as an exhibition room for ancestors’ items including a chest, lifestyle accessories, brassware, jars, bags, and a small dining table. As a tea field is located directly behind the anchae, the house also runs a tea ceremony program on the wooden floor of the anchae.

Gyodong Gaon is located right in the middle of the main street of Jeonju Hanok Village. The word "gaon" means "middle" in Korean. It's a two-story traditional Korean house that stands out among the rest of the traditional Korean houses in the alley leading to Omokdae. Just inside the gate is a yard with colorful flower trees, jars of sauces, and furnace. The mural on one of the walls is popular among the guests as a place to take photos.
The "numaru", or "loft" in Korean, overlooks the Hanok Village, and is one of the best places in the village to get a closer look at the 500 year old zelkova tree and the foot of the mountain nearby. Open to all the guests, the "numaru" is very popular during the winter as well as the summer. It's an open space with a wooden floor, so it's very cool during the summer, and it also serves as an observatory to enjoy the view of all the snow-covered trees and roofs in the Hanok Village during the winter while having a hot cup of tea.
The owner of the guesthouse has been living here for 37 years. He rebuilt his house and turned it into a hanok guesthouse in 2014 while making sure the rooms are well insulated and comfortable to stay.
He built a two-story building to make an efficient use of the space, and focused on making all the rooms look different. The house has five rooms, and only the “Meomulda Room” on the first floor is the only rooms with a living room separated from the bedroom. All you have to do is open the door to enjoy the view of the yard, Hanok Village, and Omokdae. The “Nanuda Room” on the second floor is the largest one that can accommodate more than five people, making it the most popular choice among families. The "Damda Room" and "Kkumkkuda Room" both have an attic that can be reached by a ladder. The attic is big enough to sleep two adults, and some guests actually sleep there for a unique experience. One of the walls of the attic is finished with cypress wood which has a pleasant scent. The “Geurida Room” has the best view through the two windows on the either side of the room, in addition to warm sunlight and cool wind that come through the window. Modern, not traditional, doors are installed in all the rooms for better sound proofing and insulation.
Gyodong Gaon offers a number of experience programs, such as traditional games like “gulleongsoe”, “tuho", and “Korean top”, As well as “sabang chigi”, “sampalseon”, and “ttangttameokgi”.
Many Korean adults are familiar with these games, while children and foreigners can find these games interesting. All these traditional Korean games are free to play.

The village of Gaesil is known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan.

Boasting over 300 years of tradition, the village is home to sixty households as well as a number of cultural heritages including the head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62), Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage material No. 111), which is the old village school, and the printing woodblocks for a collection of literary works including Yijonrok (a book about the life and achievements of Kim’s father Kim Suk-ja) written by Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 175).

The mountain, cypress grove, and beach are all visible from the main floored hall room. For this reason, many of the guests who stayed here say that the picturesque view seems to change day by day. The town where the guesthouse is located is specially designed as a 'hanok village,' consisting mostly of traditional Korean houses of Jeollanam-do. It is also widely known as 'Haenam Kimchi Village' because of their famous cabbages, which are grown in the natural environment and are used to make kimchi.
Specifically, there are three villages in this area: 'Green Experience Village,' 'Farm Stay Village,' and 'Resort Village.' There is a public swimming pool in the area managed by the villagers and is very popular among visitors, with ticket sales reaching KRW 100,000,000 a year. One of the advantages of staying at this guesthouse is that it’s within a one-hour ride to a number of popular nature destinations such as Wando Cheongsando Island, Gangjin Dasan Chodang, Jangheung Cheongwansan Mountain, Woodland, and Yeongam Wolchunsan Mountain. Haenam is known as one of the best regions of Korea for enjoying the famous Jeolla-do cuisine, so visitors to Haenam are advised to try the local food.
The villagers built these traditional Korean guesthouses so that their visitors can have a day of relaxation in nature, away from their hectic city life. With this mind, they used natural pinewood and red clay from Gangwon-do to build authentic traditional Korean houses and utilized traditional Korean tiles from Goryeong. The name 'Haemaru Healing Forest' was given by the owner of the guesthouse, with the subtitle 'A place where you can tell your story.' The guesthouse buildings are in 'ㄱ' shape. The main building, called 'anchae' in Korean, has floor area of 72m², which is big enough for up to 25 people. There are two rooms, a large living room, and a kitchen in this building. The rooms are furnished with sofa, television, air conditioner, refrigerator, and table just like an ordinary home so that guests can feel at home during their stay. The 'bakkatchae,' or 'detached house,' is a single room with capacity of 6 and is furnished with air conditioner and bathroom.
The guesthouse is owned by a couple who still work in Seoul and need to travel back and forth between Seoul and Haenam frequently. They're both nature lovers, so their most favorite place in the house is the kitchen garden where they cultivate their own organic lettuce, perilla leaves, and chili peppers. The kitchen garden is open to guests who want to try the homegrown organic vegetables. Various experience programs are offered here as well, such as yunnori, dadeumi, jwibulnori, and kimchi making. Jwibulnori is a traditional Korean game played on the eve of Daeboreum or First Full Moon Day, where people burn dry grass on the ridges of rice paddies and fields and others spin cans of flames attached to the end of a stick or a sling. For safety reasons, this game is played with the consent and participation of the villagers, so be sure to ask the owner of the guesthouse when the game is played. It’s free for groups of more than 10 people. As for the kimchi-making class, it is offered by the guesthouse owner's younger brother and sister-in-law who live and run a kimchi factory in the village. They will teach you how to make kimchi, step-by-step, start to end. The kimchi-making class is a paid program, so be sure to ask the guesthouse owner how much and when the class is held.|23|+82-10-2332-6303|Haemaru Healing Forest [Korea Quality] / 해마루 힐링숲 [한국관광 품질인증]|59054|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

The Dueok Happy Dream Village Farming Association Corporation runs a hanok-style guesthouse situated in Dueok Happy Dream Village, which is surrounded by high, clean mountains. Also known as Bongseogol, the village is a pleasant farming community located deep in the lush green mountains of Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do, and is also well known as one of the eight best propitious sites in Korea – Jongnamsan Mountain on its right and Seobangsan Mountain on its left are said to resemble a phoenix('Bonghwang' in Korean) embracing the village (hence the name of the village is ‘Bongseo’). 
Dueok Village was re-born as Dueok Happy Dream Village as part of the rural village revitalization project carried out in Wanju County. The village has jointly run diverse hanok buildings (ranging from about 45 to 150 years old) as hanok-style guesthouses, along with various hands-on programs, since 2010. The Dueok Happy Dream Village Farming Association Corporation now runs the guestrooms and a large experience center, and only accepts groups of guests. The experience center offers education programs on traditional etiquette, and also operates reenactments of the ancient civil service examination.

It consists of a small sarangchae (men’s quarters) with two wing buildings at sides. As the anchae (women’s quarters), large sarang, daemungan (gate building), and shrine were built by Ryu’s great-grandson, Ryu Do-seong (who served as a governor of Gyeongsang-do), in 1862 (the 13th year of the reign of King Cheoljong), the house displays the typical features of a Joseon nobleman’s house and is the largest in Hahoe. 
The large sarangbang, Bukchonyugeo (measuring 7-kan* at the front, 3-kan at the sides), consists of two 2-kan rooms, two 1-kan rooms, a 4-kan daecheong (wooden floor), a 3-kan numaru (upper floor), a 3-kan kitchen, a 3-kan garret, a 5-kan toe (the narrow wooden veranda running along the outside of the building), and a jjokmaru (narrow wooden veranda). The entire building can be converted into a single space simply by opening the sliding doors between the rooms and the doors between the rooms and the daecheong. 
The medium-sized sarang, Hwagyeongdang, consists of a 2-kan room, a 1-kan daecheong, a 3-kan toe, and a jjokmaru, while the small sarang, Susinwa, consists of a 1-kan room, a 1-kan daecheong, and a 2-kan toe. The anchae has a courtyard in the middle, a kitchen, a main room, a daecheong, a gobang (storeroom), a witsangbang (upper room), a toenmaru (a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the building), an araetsangbang, a jungmun that links to the large sarang, an araetgwang (storeroom), a dwiju (grain-chest), and a munganbang (gate building room). The munganchae (gate building) and shrine are also situated within the grounds of the house, along with a 300-year-old pine tree that is known for its curved shape, which is said to resemble the Nakdonggang River as it meanders around the village of Hahoe. 
The house contains valuable cultural heritages including Doseongpaldojido (Map of the Eight Provinces of Korea), which is estimated to date from the seventeenth century, and is regarded as an invaluable historic material as it includes Dokdo Island and Jiandao as part of the Korean territory, and a painting titled ‘Sehwa,’ which is believed to have been given to Ryu Yi-jwa (pen-name: Hakseo, 1763-1837) by the king as a New Year’s present. Bukchondaek House was built by one of the richest families in Hahoe, who are well known for their generosity as they have helped local people on many occasions throughout history.

“Andonog Hahoe Yangjindang,” located in the Hahoe Folk Village, is Treasure No 306 and the residence of a family with the surname Pungsan Ryu. A tablet read Ipam Antique House, named after Ipam Ryu Jung Yeong (1515 - 1573), is hung on the entrance. Yangjindang is named after the nickname of Ryu Yeong (1687 - 1761), the sixth generation of Gyeongam Ryu Un Ryong, son of Ipam. The name means “nourishing well one's own nature.” The Hanok stands over the entrance, with a well-polished floor that is grand yet friendly. One of the characteristics of the house is that it includes Sarangcha or detached building, which reflects the architecture from the Goryeo period, and Anchae or main building in the architecture style from the Joseon period. 
It is expected that such co-existence was made possible because of the repairs done after Imjin War. How fortiunate that the antique house has been preserved until now! The well-tended garden shows the commitment of the descendants to maintaining the space. Rooms are rather simple compared to the grand exterior of the house. Traditional mother-of-pearl furniture, tableware in the cupboard, randomly ceramics placed draw attention. The house resembles a small folk museum. Why not enjoy some traditional folk games during your stay? There is a variety of play tools such as yut, tuho, jegi, tops, and kites. Experience programs such as gayangju brewing, rice cake and traditional dessert making, and flower tea are conducted by the first daughter-in-law of the house, depending on the season.

'Hakbong Head House is the head house of the Uiseong Kim clan and was originally built near Sogyeseodang Village School by Kim Gwang-chan, an 8th-generation descendant of Hakbong Kim Seong-il, in 1762. In 1964, the house was moved to its current location. 
The main building (bonchae) was extended from a ‘ㅁ’-shaped structure to a ‘巳’–shape structure. The anchae (women’s quarters) consists of a daecheong (main floored room) measuring 2-kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns) on the right, an anbang measuring 2-kan on the left, and kitchen at the end. The upper part of the low-ceilinged kitchen has a gobang (storeroom) in which household goods used to be stored. The daecheong is large compared to the overall size of the house because head houses usually held many ancestral rites. 
The Hakbong Head House has an impressive modern garden that was created during construction work carried out when the house was relocated after the Japanese colonial era. The well-maintained garden with its fantastically-shaped trees and rocks also serves as a venue for musical concerts on a regular basis. Guests will surely be fascinated to find out about the history of the people who once inhabited this house and dedicated themselves to the country in times of trouble.

Guesthouse Mon Oncle a Seoul is a 'hanok' guesthouse located in Bukchon Hanok Village in Gye-dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul, in the alley on the hill right across from Seoul Choong Ang High School, which was often used as filming location for popular Korean TV dramas. Because it’s situated on a hill, guests can enjoy a charming view of the traditional Korean houses under the hill from the living room, a beautiful sunset view, and a view of Inwangsan Mountain in the distance. The guesthouse and the neighborhood are very quiet, which is very unusual considering the fact that it's right at the center of downtown Seoul. Built in 2015, the guesthouse is very clean and comfortable. Despite being a new building, it has all the characteristics of a traditional Korean house called 'hanok,' such as roof tiles, front yard, and 'ㅁ'-shaped buildings. Except for the kitchen and bathroom, which are modern, everything about the guesthouse is traditional. The living room is furnished with table and chairs for the guests to use. The kitchen is located in a corner of the living room, complete with kitchen sink, refrigerator, and washing machine open to all the guests. 
The guesthouse has four rooms, two of which are barely big enough to accommodate up to two people. The two other rooms are big enough to accommodate up to five people. The rooms are mostly bare without any decor just like most of the rooms in traditional Korean houses, where the ceiling rafters are visible. Each room has traditional bedclothes, furniture, and lighting. A special discount rate will be applied to those who book the entire house or stay there for a long period of time. 
Because the buildings in all four directions face each other, all the guests must pass through the front yard in order to go to or come out of their room. The front yard is not very big, but big enough for the guests to have a chat or enjoy barbecue. The living room serves as a cafe, where guests can share their experiences or have breakfast together. The guesthouse is designed this way because the owner of the guesthouse likes to mingle with people. He built the guesthouse not only for business but also to meet people who love to travel like him. He even named the place 'Uncle' because he wants to be close to his guests. He actually goes hiking with his guests and gives them a tour of the town. He’s also an excellent cook, so be sure to try the breakfast before starting your tour for the day.

Hanok Story in Hyanggyo-gil in Jeonju Hanok Village is a traditional Korean house built over 60 years ago and was recently renovated to serve as a guesthouse. Thus, it boasts of modern convenient facilities but preserves most of the features of a traditional Korean house, which was home to the guesthouse owner and his wife for over 35 years. The couple put old books, LPs, old movie posters, Korean lunch boxes, and old television on display in every corner of the house to create an old look and finish. In the yard is a 50-year-old persimmon tree that provides cool shade during the summer and delicious persimmons in the fall. All the old items in the house have a story to tell, and that's why the owner named his guesthouse "Hanok Story." 
At the entrance of the house is a Korean phrase meaning “Enjoy the Five Blessings (longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, and peaceful death) generation after generation with the energy of the sun, moon, and stars.” That’s why the rooms are named “Geumbit (Golden Light),” “Haetbit (Sunlight),” “Dalbit (Moonlight),” and “Byeolbit (Starlight).” The phrase is also engraved on top of the door to the "Haetbit Room." There are a total of seven guestrooms -- four in the main building and the "Solbit Room," "Deluxe Room No. 1," and "Deluxe Room No. 2." All the rooms are furnished with bathroom, TV, and air conditioner. Deluxe Room No. 2 has a kitchen for the guests to cook. There is a garden of sowbread, balloon vine, and hydrangea in the yard.
There is also a cafeteria made of cypress wood in the yard. The walls are covered with post-its left by the guests as well as musical instruments and dolls. It's where tea and breakfast are served. Homemade Korean breakfast is served for free. A tea class is also available during the weekend upon reservation.

The House of Sogang is an approximately 110-year-old house located in the village of Baraemi in Bonghwa-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do. It was originally built for and presented to Kim Chang-gi (pen-name: Sogang), a well-known local Confucian scholar who served as the head of the Dosanseowon Confucian Academy, and who happened to be the second son of Kim Roe-sik (pen-name: Namho), the great-grandfather of the current owner. 
Furthermore, the House of Namho, which is situated behind the House of Sogang, was built for the first son of Kim Roe-sik, one of the richest men in the region, who borrowed money using his entire property as security and donated it to a war chest. He won an official commendation for his role in helping secure national independence in 1977.  

The entire village pf Baraemi is composed of traditional square-shaped houses with tiled roofs set amid a clean and peaceful atmosphere, for which it was designated as a Traditional Cultural Village way back in 1922. The name of the village, Baraemi, implies that it was originally situated by the sea, and many shell remains have been found in paddy fields and puddles there over the last 60 years.

The House of Namho is a typical square-shaped house with a tiled roof, and comprises a tall gate, a front courtyard, a sarangchae (men’s quarters) with maru (wooden floor), an inner courtyard, and a bonchae (main building) among its various structures. The main construction material of the house is Chunyang pine wood, which is a rarely used these days. Thanks to the owner-family’s dedicated maintenance and care, the house has been preserved in good condition. As the typical residence of a nobleman of the late Joseon period, the house is decorated with simple interior objects including an old electric fan and a cabinet inlaid with mother-of-pearl.

The house has seven guestrooms in total: The sarangchae consists of the Keunsarang and Jakeunsarang, each with a capacity of 4 to 5 people, and the Araetbang with a capacity of 2 to 3 people. In summer, guests can rent the Jakeunsarang and Sarangdaecheong together, or the Araetbang and Marutbang together, in order to have more space. 
In addition, the anchae has a sangbang with a capacity of 3 to 4 people, while the mugangchae consists of Mungangbang 1, which is a red clay floor-heated room, and Mungangbang 2, which can accommodate 2 to 5 people. In summer it is possible to rent the entire House of Sogang, which can accommodate anywhere from 22 to 34 people (if the Sarangmaru and Marutbang are also rented). 
Guests of the Keunsarang and Jakeunsarang can use a communal refrigerator, and the entire building has Wi-Fi access. Clean bedding is also provided. Although the house doesn’t provide a breakfast, the owner offers guests sweetcorn, sweet potatoes, fruit, etc. The house is also equipped with a BBQ facility, so guests can enjoy a BBQ party in the evening.

Guests can easily reach various nearby cultural heritage sites, including Muryangsujeon Hall of Buseoksa Temple, Sosuseowon Confucian Academy, which was the first Confucian Academy of Korea, Ojeon Mineral Spring, Daksil Village, and Chukseosa Temple.

Huewon is a cozy hanok guesthouse located in Seoak-dong, Gyeongju. Since Gyeongju had been the capital of the Silla Dynasty for about a thousand years, Huewon is surrounded by various cultural heritage sites such as Tomb of King Muyeol, Tomb of King Jinji, and Seoakseowon Confucian Academy with a serene atmosphere. <br />
Built in the 1970s and renovated later, Huewon started its accommodations service around 2011. Entering the gate, one can see a square-shaped courtyard giving a very bright and warm impression, in the middle of which is an old beautiful magnolia tree that is popular among visitors. <br />
The garden is well-arranged with flower trees and bonsai trees and decorated with vintage items such as an old well and a water pump. Behind the house, the surroundings along with the low-altitude Seondosan Mountain make for beautiful seasonal scenery. <br>
This cozy and pleasant hanok house has been well-maintained with the will and care of the owner, preserving the traditional hanok features including columns, beams, and rafters of the ceiling that show traces of time past. <br />
The guestrooms are bright and clean with a delicate fragrance.&nbsp; Aside from red clay walls and clean beddings, however, there are no other additional facilities such as BBQ set because the guesthouse seeks to offer guests a quiet, healthy, and stable environment.<br />
The guesthouse’s host, who has lived in Gyeongju for about 30 years and has engaged in promoting Gyeongju’s cultural heritages, willingly recommends to guests special travel destinations in Gyeongju and tells stories about Gyeongju. <br>
In particular, the way to Dobongseodang Village School located behind Huewon is highly recommended by the host. Going up to the village school early morning, one is treated to a fantastic open view of Gyeongju in the fog. Moreover, Namsan Mountain, nicknamed Outdoor Museum since it is full of various Buddhist statues and towers here and there, is another recommended destination near the guesthouse. <br>|2|+82-10-5651-1253|Huewon [Korea Quality] / 휴원 [한국관광 품질인증]|38064|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

The head houses of the Gyeongju Son clan and the Yeogang Yi clan are situated in this traditional village, along with typical hanok houses of Joseon noblemen and the thatched houses of commoners. 
Among the houses in the village, Hyangdang House stands out as it is located around Mulbong Hill. The house was built in 1540 by King Jungjong (r. 1506-1544) for the mother of Yi Eon-jeok (pen-name: Hoejae, 1491-1553). It originally measured 99-kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns), but part of the house was destroyed during the Korean War (1950-53), leaving only 56-kan of the original structure. 
Hyangdan House was built in close harmony with nature, so its structure is distinct from that of other hanok houses. As it was built on a slope, the x_heights of its various structures differ considerably. For instance, the daemungan (gate building) of the haengrangchae (servants’ quarters) was built by placing the foundation stones on the incline and then building the gate on top of them. In particular, there are no staircases leading up to the main gate at the front, but there is a side door adjacent to the gate through which one can enter the house. In addition, the sarangchae (men’s quarters) located behind the haengrangchae on the higher ground can be reached via the staircases. The other structures, such as the kitchen, anchae (women’s quarters), and geonneonbang (a room opposite the main living room) are located at different levels, protecting them from exposure to the outside. Therefore, thanks to the high position of the house, it is luminous and commands an excellent view. Furthermore, the anchae is situated in the middle of the house, which enables the occupants to reach the rest of the house easily. The anbang (main living room) connects to the daecheong (main floored room) toward the south. 
Hyangdan House runs a variety of experience programs such as a woodblock printing program in which participants can write a letter using woodblock printing on hanji (traditional Korean paper handmade from mulberry tree); a traditional etiquette program including the wearing of hanbok (traditional Korean clothes); a tea ceremony with lotus tea; and a natural dyeing program in which participants learn how to use natural materials to dye fabric (bag, clothes, etc.). It is recommended to book the desired experience program when reserving a room at the guesthouse. 
The house comprises four guestrooms in the anchae, three rooms in the additional building (busokchae), and two rooms in the haengrangchae, all of which are often fully booked.|2|+82-10-6689-3575|Hyangdan House [Korea Quality] / 향단 [한국관광 품질인증]|38006|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Inwoo House, meaning 'the house of Inwoo,' is inhabited by the owner couple and eight-year-old son Inwoo and his younger brother Yeonwoo. The couple, who have always lived in Bukchon, moved to Inwoo House in 2010; their parents run another guesthouse -- Yeonwoo House -- in Gahoe-dong, which isn’t far from Inwoo House.

Today, you can see new as well as old houses there. “Inyeon” is one of the traditional Korean houses located near the public parking lot on the outskirts of the hanok village, making it a great place to stay overnight in quiet. The word "inyeon" means "relationship" in Korean, referring to all types of ties with other people. The owner of the guesthouse named the place as such because she is greatful for all the guests and wanted to treat them well. She opened the guesthouse in September 2014. Since then, she has been kind enough to tell her guests which places are good to visit and which foods are delicious. She makes sure all the facilities including sheets and blankets are maintained clean for her guests to have a memorable stay. Built in the 1960's and remodeled in 2008, the traditional house is neat with most of the traditional features. It has four guestrooms named "Apricot Flower", "Orchid", "Chrysenthemum", and "Bamboo".

There are lots of traditional items in the yard with which you can play traditional Korean games such as "yutnori" and "jegichagi", all of which can be used by the guests for free.

The old house features the characteristic construction elements of a Joseon hanok, including the stylobate, wooden pillars, toenmaru (the narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the building), tiled roof, and other structures, and commands an open view of Imha Lake. 
The house was originally built by Ryu Gwan-hyeon, the great-great-grandfather of Ryu Chi-myeong, in 1735 (the 11th year of the reign of King Yeongjo of Joseon) in the village of Handeul in Imdong-myeon, Andong-si, Gyeongsangbuk-do, but it was relocated to the foot of Guamsan Mountain in 1987 when Imha Dam was built and the surrounding area was submerged as a result. 
The house consists of the daemunchae (gate building), jeongchim (a ‘ㅁ’-shaped house with a tiled roof), haengnangchae (servants’ quarters), a shrine, and a pavilion. 
The sarangchae (men’s quarters) is clearly visible, while the anchae (women’s quarters) is concealed within the house. The sarangchae has a sarangmaru (wooden floor), a large sarangbang room, a small sarangbang room, and there is a small maru between the two rooms. The buildings of the sarangchae and anchae are clearly divided into segregated spaces for men and women according to Confucian tradition. The anchae has a daecheongmaru (large wooden floor) in the middle; a main room, kitchen, and toilet on the right; and a numaru (upper floor) and sangbang (upper room) on the left. The small side door of the main gate links to the door by which to enter the anchae, which has a small vegetable garden. 
Manujeong Pavilion (Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Heritage Material No. 37) is a half-hipped roof building with single-layered eaves located on the left side of the house outside the main gate. It is the place where Ryu Chi-myeong used to teach his students, and consists of a large maru and a guest room. The pavilion is also surrounded by the beautiful scenery of Imha Lake, mountains, and chestnut trees. 
Jeongjae Traditional House provides two special experience programs: Making Songhwaju, which is the Ryu family’s home-brewed liquor (15 to 18 degrees) made with rice, glutinous rice, yeast, pine needles, and chrysanthemums, led by the owner’s wife (Intangible Cultural Asset No. 20); and Making Tarak, which is a fermented milk drink that has been made by the Ryu’s family for some 500 years. As the recipe for making Tarak is relatively simple, and uses yeast that is usually used to make raw rice wine like Makgeolli, people can easily make it at home. The house also runs a traditional music program designed to show participants how to play the gayageum (Korean zither with twelve strings) and sing Korean folk songs, and stages small concerts.|11|+82-10-8590-0625|Jeongjae Traditional House  [Korea Quality] / 정재종택 [한국관광 품질인증]|36732|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Inside the rooms are rafters, beams, wooden pillars walled with Hanji wallpapers, and ribs of lattice doors. There is a clean bathroom in each room.
The yard is the place the owner couple cherishes the most. Guests can enjoy the yard in any room just by opening the door. It is a combination of jar stands, a small pine tree, and small potted plants. Different flowers bloom from spring through autumn. It is such a pleasure to sit on the porch and appreciate the scene. In autumn, the persimmon tree bears fruits and dried persimmons hang from the eaves.

There is a table in the yard in front of the ‘ㄱ’-shaped house. Behind the house is a café where breakfast is served. The house has an open space between the rooms called "toetmaru", which serves as a living room as in all traditional Korean houses. It’s where Koreans used to rest under the warm sunlight in the old days. The guests must pass through this "toetmaru" to get to the roms.

Joseon Wangga is a museum hotel built on the basis of Yeomgeundang, an old house of Lee Geun who is the grandson of Emperor Gojong. Yeomgeundang was constructed in 1807 and was moved from Jongno-gu, Seoul, to Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi-do to keep the architectural heritage of the traditional royal family of Korea. After 5 months of dismantling work, all the roof tiles, crossbeam, rafters, pillars, foundation stones, stylobate stones, terrace stones, etc. were moved to the current place and Joseon Wangga was completed by reassembling the house for 27 months. As a result, the hidden royal house was turned into an open space for everyone to stay and experience. Staying at the royal house is the same as experiencing the culture of the royal family. There are 15 rooms in total and all the rooms are equipped with bathroom, air conditioner, refrigerator, etc. Smoke therapy and making herbal soaps are offered as experiencing programs. A tea ceremony set is prepared in the room, and paid breakfast of Eosuri Bap (Rice mixed with cow parsnip) can be served if a reservation is made in advance.

The Lang House of the Gaesil Village Farming Association Corporation is a hanok style of accommodation that has one spacious guestroom consisting of a bedroom, kitchen and bathroom, with a capacity of 4 to 6 people. This tile-roofed hanok with a wooden door and white walls is fully equipped with all the modern amenities including TV, fridge, air-conditioner, toiletries, Internet, cable and so on. Guests can cook with the cooking utensils provided in the kitchen and hold a BBQ party outdoors. However, the guests are expected to supply the charcoal themselves.
Known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan, Gaesil Village was founded by the descendants of Kim Jong-jik (pen-name: Jeompiljae, 1431-1492), a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar of the early Joseon period who died during the Literati Purge of 1498. The head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62) and Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage Material No. 111), the old village school, are also situated in the village. In addition, the nearby Daegaya Museum displays the writing accessories of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 209). 
The village is also known as Gaehwasil, meaning “a beautiful valley with blooming flowers” as it is surrounded by a flower-covered mountain called Mt. Hwagaesan, a 350-year-old bamboo forest, and Jeopmubong Peak, which is said to resemble a fluttering butterfly. Over 80% of the village houses are traditional hanok buildings nestled amid a cozy environment. 
During the Campaign to Create Beautiful Communities conducted in 2001 and the Farm Experience Village Development Project in 2005, the village’s hanok were renovated or entirely rebuilt, earthen-stone walls were built, walking paths created, and refined landscaping works carried out, establishing the village in its current form. Furthermore, a village shelter, experience center, Internet café, and other facilities were built for the convenience of residents and visitors alike. In recognition of the villager’ efforts to revitalize their community, Gaesil was awarded the presidential citation at the Korea Rural Village Awards in 2011. 
Designated as a NongHyup’s Farm Stay Village in 2003, Gaesil operates a wide variety of hands-on experience programs relating to nature, agriculture, and local traditions, such as collecting sweet potatoes and rice planting; Korean traditional etiquette and tea ceremony; kite making and straw handicrafts; traditional food experiences such as yeot (Korean hard taffy) and yugwa (deep-fried sweet rice cakes); traditional games such as riding on a swing and neolttwigi (Korean see-saw); as well as loach fishing, ice sledding and so on. Gaesil Village, a representative farm stay village that “blooms” in every season, attracts around 50-60,000 visitors every year.

Manhoe Historic House is located in the village of Baraemi, whose name means “a village under the sea.” As a place where literary and intellectual endeavors have flourished since ancient times, Manhoe Historic House’s representative structure is Myeongwolu Pavilion, where ancestors studied and recited poetry amid the beautiful landscape of Sobaeksan Mountain. It is said that about 1,000 poems were composed at the pavilion in the old days. 
The house is also the birthplace of the independence movement in Korea. Local Confucian scholars led by Independence activist Kim Chang-suk gathered together at the pavilion right after the March 1st Movement in 1919 and wrote the petition for Korea’s Independence, which was eventually submitted to the Paris Peace Conference. Recently, many hundreds of letters exchanged between independence activists were also discovered at the house. 

The house is a square-shaped hanok structure consisting of a ‘ㄷ’-shaped anchae (women’s quarters), a ‘ㅡ’-shaped sarangchae (men’s quarters), a jungmunganchae (middle gate building), and a courtyard. The anchae, which is over 320 years old, has been inhabited by the descendants of Kim Geon-su, a civil official of the late Joseon period, for six generations, The sarangchae, which is over 200 years old, was added to the original house at a later date. 

The house was mainly built with red and solid Chunyang pine wood, and is well preserved as a result. The sarangchae has a half-hipped roof, and comprises a sarangbang (main room), daecheong (main floored room), geonneonbang (a room opposite the main room), and toenmaru (a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the building). The guestrooms of the sarangchae and jungmunganchae include the Sarangbang, Seonangsil, and Baraemisil Rooms, of which the Sarangbang and Seonangsil are equipped with an individual indoor bathroom. 
In particular, the anchae is a cozy well-insulated building comprising a daecheong in the middle, a sangbang room on the left, and a gobang (storeroom) and anbang (main room) on the right. 
Every room of the anchae is decorated with paintings by the owner’s daughter, fabric artworks, and antique wooden furniture. The anbang, which has an attic and indoor bathroom, can accommodate up to eight people. Guests of the sangbang and gobang need to use the external bathroom. 
Right next to the house is a farm covering an area of 6,600m2 where over 100 kinds of crops are cultivated organically, including wildflowers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, corns, peanuts, salad leaves and other vegetables, which are available for guests. Although the house doesn’t provide a breakfast, guests can pick vegetables in the field and cook them in the communal kitchen or at the BBQ facility in the outer yard.  Meanwhile, the nearby Songyigukbapjip restaurant specializes in the delicious local dish made with pine mushrooms. 
The house provides a variety of traditional experience activities including Tuho (stick throwing), Seunggyeongdo (chess), Neolttwigi (Korean jumping game similar to see-saw), Sijo composition (traditional Korean three-verse poem), a traditional musical instrument experience (six-stringed Korean zither, seven-stringed instrument, gong, etc.), and a woodblock printing experience.

Mopyeongheon House was built about 100 years ago as the head house by a 9th–generation descendant of the Papyeong Yoon clan. It was solidly built over a period of three years using pine wood that had been soaked in seawater for seven years and dried for fifteen years to prevent any changes in the wood. 
Among the old tiled-roof houses of the village, Mopyeongheon House is notable for its simple yet elegant beauty. Its curved tiled-roof, straight doors, rounded pillars and wooden rafters form a harmonious beauty with the surrounding bamboo grove and green tea fields. 
The house was opened as a tourist accommodation in 2009 after renovation work to modernize the kitchen and bathroom. Glass windows were built into the toenmaru (the narrow wooden porch running along the outside of the building) to shut out draughts from outside and to allow guests to see the bamboo grove. There is a BBQ facility in the back yard, and a small vegetable garden with chili peppers and lettuce for guests. All of the rooms have clean bedding and are equipped with a TV, computer, mirror, tea set (green tea leaves are provided by the owner), etc. 
Guests will enjoy relaxing amid the serene natural environment which includes Ansaem Spring, a forest with trees over 300 years old, a stream, and nearby attractions including eight pavilions and various historic houses.

It is said that although the king granted him a government post on eighteen occasions, Yun, being a straightforward sort of person, declined them all. As he practiced the virtue of simplicity and sharing in life and taught it to younger generations, the house escaped destruction during the Donghak Peasant Revolution (1894) and the Korean War (1950-1953) thanks to the efforts of his disciples. Thus, in keeping with his character, the house looks moderate compared to the homes of other aristocrats, although it exhibits a refined interior and a scientific design. 

The house consists of a sarangchae (men’s quarters), anchae (women’s quarters), and daecheongmaru (main floored room) configured in a square layout. The sarangchae itself consists of the keun sarangbang (large room) flanked by a daecheong and a numaru with an open view of the village and a mountain, the jakeun sarangbang (small room), the ansarangbang (inner room), and the daemungan (gate). To the right of the house is the spectacular sight created by a platform filled with hundreds of crocks for traditional sauces and condiments.
The wall situated between the sarangchae and the anchae was designed to prevent people from looking into the anchae.  There is also an open space below the wall from which one could see the shoes of a visitor, thus enabling the occupants of the anchae to know whether there was a visitor or not in the sarangchae. In addition, the gotganchae (storage quarters) situated next to the anchae is designed in such a way that it diminishes in size towards the north because the summer wind blowing from the south escapes the narrow passageway of the north, so it blows faster and the surrounding area gets colder, while the wind winter blowing from the north escapes the large passageway of the south, protecting the building from the bitter wind of the north. Therefore, the storeroom at the north end of the gotganchae remains cool even in summer, thereby preserving the things (food and other commodities) stored there. 
The guestrooms of the house include the three sarangbang rooms in the sarangchae building and the geonneonbang (a room opposite the main living room) in the anchae. The entire sarangchae building including the numaru can be rented too. Guests can also rent the thatched-roof byeolchae in the courtyard, which features a choyeondang equipped with a sound system and a beam projector, as well as a modern bathroom, for group meetings or performances. The house also runs a variety of paid traditional experience programs including Gukak (Korean classical music), tea ceremony, natural dyeing, and so on.
Other noteworthy features of the house include the sarangchae’s distinctive gate, which combines a sliding door with a hinged door, the looming presence of a mountain to its rear, and the little round island (pond) planted with an old crape myrtle at its front.|3|+82-41-735-1215, +82-10-6310-1139|Myeongjae Historic House [Korea Quality] / 논산 명재고택 [한국관광 품질인증]|32903|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

As a guesthouse located in Gyeongun-dong, Jongno-gu, Namhyundang is a traditional Korean house built more than 100 years ago; this is the reason 70-80% of the guests are foreign tourists who wish to experience the tradition of Korea. One of the regular guests is a British national who has frequented the place for the past three years. He even left some of his clothes in the guesthouse for his next visit. Both the owner of the pension and his son are architects, and they saw to it that the rooms are well-insulated by coating the walls with a thick layer of natural red clay since most traditional Korean houses are not insulated enough. They take pride in their rooms and feel that their work was worthwhile whenever guests suffering from insomnia had a good night's sleep thanks to the red clay. One of the most outstanding features of the guesthouse is the large front yard, which is often used as a venue for concert, first birthday party, seminar, and year-end party. Until November before it gets too cold, breakfast is also served in the yard. Some guests have a barbecue party with other guests at night to socialize while enjoying the food.

'As a traditional Korean house with floor area of 99m², Nocwoonjae has been in business since 2014 in Oseong Hanok Village, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do. The name 'Nocwoonjae' means 'a house with a green cloud hanging over it' in Korean. It was named as such because of the green broad-leaved and coniferous trees along the foot of the mountain in the vicinity of the guesthouse. The entrance way is lined with flowers and trees, leading to two Korean houses connected by an open hallway. The guesthouse is owned by two sisters who built this place after staying at many of the popular 'hanok (traditional Korean house)' guesthouses in other parts of the country. It was a dream come true for them, so they did everything in their power to make their place perfect by choosing the building materials themselves, even the tiles. Because the exterior walls are made of red clay and tiles, it's cool in summer and warm in winter. There is also a large wooden floor hall where guests can enjoy the nature. The rooms are decorated with embroidered cotton sheets and antique furniture. Both of the sisters are amateur oriental painters specializing in painting the 'Four Gracious Plants (Plum, Orchid, Chrysanthemum, and Bamboo)', so they even made the lamps with traditional Korean paper with their paintings on them. Indeed, they did everything they could to make this place as pretty as possible.
The two traditional Korean houses named Naunchae and Unachae are built on a natural slope without harming the nature. The two houses are connected by a hallway with windows, so guests can sit on the staircase to enjoy the view outside. The 'Naunchae,' which means 'silky cloud' in Korean, consists of a room, an attic, a kitchen, a hall, and a bathroom. From the attic, you can have a great view of the trees and pine grove through the window. Right behind the house are the strawberry garden and stone walls for the guests to relax. The walls and floor of the room are made of red clay and natural wood with a pleasant natural aroma, which is good for the mind and body. The kitchen walls are made of colorful tiles and wood, with a large window right next to it offering a great view of the pine grove. In the main hall, guests can throw open the large window and lay on the wooden floor to look at the nature and enjoy the breeze.
The 'Unachae,' which means 'beautiful cloud' in Korean, consists of tea room, guestroom, kitchen, hall, and bathroom. It's very similar to the 'Naunchae,' except for the long window next to the kitchen and a table underneath it. The guesthouse sometimes offers special discounts, so be sure to ask about them when booking a room.
There are different types of flowers in the front yard, including cosmos, rose moss, and cockscomb. The sisters also grow corn, sorghum, strawberries, persimmon, jujube, and plum trees there. In the harvest season, guests can pick and try the fruits and vegetables. The sisters also offer a number of experience programs, such as Oriental painting class where you can grind the ink stick and paint the Four Gracious Plants on traditional Korean paper and tea class where you can try the tea made of the persimmon leaves and flowers grown by the owners. Breakfast includes toast, jam, and milk. There is a kitchen, so you can cook whatever you want. Popular tourist destinations in the vicinity of the guesthouse include Songgwangsa Temple and Wibongsa Temple as well as the 60m-high Wibong Falls, one of the Eight Views of Wansan Mountain. Jeonju Hanok Village is a 20-minute ride from the guesthouse.

The guesthouse also has a rooftop garden from which you can enjoy the landscape of Jirisan Mountain. There is a bus going to Nogodan Peak, and a round-trip ticket costs KRW 15,000. Note, however, that the bus doesn't run during winter, so it's the best time of the year for serious hikers who prefer walking rather than taking a bus. The owner of the guesthouse sometimes serves as mountain guide upon the request of his guests. And Located on the ground floor of Nogodan Guesthouse, BUEN CAMINO is a restaurant & pub for travelers. Dishes are cooked to order, with ingredients produced in Gurye near Mt. Jirisan. Seasonal vegetables and side dishes are served with the following main dishes: Jirisan Black Pork BBQ, Jirisan Zucchini Stew, and Jirisan Pan-dried Zucchini. It is possible to order for one person for every item on the menu. If you are going to have Jirisan Black Pork BBQ, you'd better make a reservation in advance so that you can save time and enjoy the meal in a more pleasant and comfortable atmosphere.

It is said that Yi Gye-yang abandoned his government position after he fell victim to the Gyeyujeongnan Suppression (a coup d’état instigated by Suyang Prince, who became King Sejo of Joseon, in 1455) and returned to his hometown in Bonghwa, where he devoted himself to teaching students. He built the house in its current location by a coincidence of saving a monk.
The Placenta Chamber of Yi Hwang, which is situated deep in the house, consists of an Ondol (Korean floor heating) Room and a small numaru (upper floor) with a unique design.  The gate bears a signboard with the word ‘Seonglimmun’ written by Hakbong Kim Seong-il (a direct disciple of Yi Hwang), which derives from the fact that the mother of Yi Hwang, Chuncheon Park, had a conception dream about Confucius entering the main gate with his disciples.
Nosongjeong has an Ondol room in the west, with a numaru and a maru (wooden floor) in the east, which could accommodate 20 to 30 students. The signboard of Noseongjeong is believed to have been written by Han Seok-bong (a leading calligrapher of the mid-Joseon period). The structure of Nosongjeong is considered an invaluable resource for studies on the principles of building a half-hipped roof. 
The shrine is situated east of Nosongjeong, between which there was a juniper aged over 400 years from which the name of Nosongjeong was originated as people called the juniper as an old (no) pine (song). However, the original juniper has been replaced by its younger juniper tree with an umbrella shape of the top.|11|+82-10-2065-3749|Nosongjeong Head House [Korea Quality] / 노송정종택(퇴계상가) [한국관광 품질인증]|36604|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Located in the middle of the ocean and covered with mountains, there are no noise and smoke pollution on the island, which is inhabited by only 20 households who moved from Dalido Island. Oedaldo Island is listed as one of the 30 Cleanest Areas in Korea. In addition to the beautiful nature, one of the most popular features of this island is the seawater swimming pool at the entrance to the village. There are two swimming pools: one for children and the other for adults. Many people actually come to this island for this swimming pool every summer.
Most of the houses on this island serve as a guesthouse. Among them, Oedaldo Hanok Pension is the only traditional Korean house built by the City of Mokpo in 2006 and sold to the current husband-and-wife owners in 2013. There is a romantic story behind how the young couple came to the island and bought the house. The husband quit his job and traveled the world for four years after a painful breakup. After coming back to Seoul, Korea, he accidentally bumped into the woman he loved. They got together again, got married, and bought this traditional Korean house to live on this island, and they continue to travel the world.
Oedaldo Hanok Pension is situated very close to the sea. The pension consists of three stand-alone houses that all face the ocean, so the guests can see and listen to the ocean just by opening the door. The pension is very popular among the visitors to this island, especially because it’s only a 30-second walk to the beach. All you will see is literally the ocean when you open the door, which means you will constantly be reminded that you're on an isolated island whenever you open the door. Built on a large plot of land, the pension has a 2314m² grass lawn from which you can savor the view of the ocean. There is a pavilion in front of each stand-alone guesthouse including barbecue facilities for the guests to use. This is one of the few guesthouses in the country where you can have the luxury of watching the ocean while enjoying barbecue or riding a swing. The 'Bipajeong' house has three single rooms with capacity of up to four people, the 'Samhakjeong' house has three single rooms with capacity of up to eight people, and the stand-alone 'Mongnyeonjeong' house is for group guests of up to 16 people, making them a great place to stay for couples, families, and groups on a workshop. All the guestrooms are furnished with television, refrigerator, air conditioner, Internet connection, bathroom, and cooking utensils for the convenience of the guests. 
There is a terrace café in front of the guesthouse built by the husband-and-wife owners when they moved in here. The café serves dried pollack hangover soup, pork cutlets, seafood and green onion pancake, and smoked chicken as well as various types of other dishes, toast, and coffee. Because it's open from 8:00am to 10:00pm, guests can have three meals a day here. The pension also offers a number of experience programs, such as traditional tea making/drinking class where you can learn the traditional Korean tea drinking etiquette while trying the tea. You must make a reservation for this tea class at least one day in advance, and there must be at least two people who will participate in the program, which costs KRW 5,000 per person. It is possible to experience wearing a hanbok because there are seven hanboks. You can wear a hanbok and have your picture taken. The experience can be had at 5,000 won per person. Other experience programs include fishing, conch picking, and mud flat. You can also try some traditional Korean games such as 'tuho (pitch-pot)' in the front yard.|8|+82-10-7257-7597|Oedaldo Hanok Pension [Korea Quality] / 외달도 한옥민박 [한국관광 품질인증]|58761|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

After building Wonjijeongsa House, Ryu wanted to build another house at the foot of Buyongdae Cliff amid a tranquil environment away from the village, but due to his financial situation he was unable to complete the building by himself. Then, the monk Tanhong helped him build Ogyeonjeongsa House, which took ten years (1576 to 1586) to complete, when Ryu was 45 years old. Later, Ryu Seong-yong was able to share warmth with his brother (Gyeomam), who lived in nearby Gyeomamjeongsa House. 
Ryu later lost his house in Hahoe in the great flood of the Nakdonggang River in 1605, and retired to Ogyeongjeongsa House where he wrote Jingbirok (The Book of Correction, National Treasure 132), a memoir of the Imjin War (Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592). 
The house’s guestrooms include Sesimjae (meaning ‘having a mind to this place to achieve at least one in ten thousand things,’ inspired by the I Ching or The Book of Changes), which was used by Ryu as a schoolhouse and has two small rooms between the maru gamheonrok (wooden floor, meaning ‘looking up at the sky and down at the blue water,’ inspired by Wang Xizhi’s poetic diction); Wonlakjae (meaning ‘waiting for a friend’s visit,’ inspired by the Analects of Confucius), in which Ryu himself resided and wrote Jingbirok; and the maru aeoheon (meaning ‘I also love my hut,’ taken from a poem by Chinese poet Tao Yuanming), which measures two kan (a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns).|11|+82-54-854-2202 / +82-10-4520-3640|Ogyeonjeongsa House [Korea Quality] / 옥연정사 [한국관광 품질인증]|36757|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Parkjinsa Gotaek in Cheonggwang-ri,Goseong is an old house of Miryang Park Clan which is #292 Cultural Material. The traditional Korean style house shows the construction method of houses during the late Joseon Dynasty. Three generations of Sungkyunkwan officials were born in this house in a span of 100 years. There is a red gate of award of the king erected at the entrance of the house to cite the devoted son. Usually the red gate of award of the king was erected at the entrance of the village to cite the devoted son, a chaste woman, or a loyal subject, and the Parkjinsa Gotaek is a rare case for which the red gate of award of the king was erected at the entrance of the house. 
The old wall of the house, which looks like a fossil bed, demonstrates the long history of the house. The well-tended garden near the gate will make you stop walking because it looks like something straight out of a movie scene. The scenery over the window from any place inside the house is as pretty as a picture. The rooms in the house are composed of 2 Anchae (inner buildings) and 4 Sarangchae (outer buildings). Both Anchae and Sarangchae are equipped with restroom and shower room. The kitchen is only in the Anchae building. Sarangchae can be used as one wide room to accommodate a maximum 10 people; it’s done by simply opening the doors dividing the small rooms. The house is used for paid educational programs of traditional tea ceremony and etiquette. The old warehouse has been remolded to be a classroom for tea ceremony classes. The place is also used as a place for events; it’s equipped with a beam projector and sound equipment for hosting seminars, workshops, etc. There is a tea ceremony room made by remodeling a building attached to Sarangchae where you can learn the wisdom of ancestors over a warm tea.

The hills surrounding the center create a cozy environment, and a grove of pine and fir trees right past the entrance adds to the beautiful natural landscape. Thanks to the clean air, you will be able to see stars in the night sky. The site originally belonged to an elementary school before being transformed into a cultural center as part of Pohang City's urban project. The center is managed and maintained by Pohang City Facilities Management Corporation as commissioned by Pohang City. As a place for learning and appreciating Korean culture in the natural landscape of Deokdong Village, which has a long history, it's now a popular field trip destination among schools. 
The Center offers various educational and character building programs designed to restore the traditional culture of Korea by providing students with an opportunity to learn their culture, including 'seodang (private village school that provided elementary education during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties),' calligraphy, tea drinking, and ecosystem classes. Other programs include 'nanta (Korean traditional percussion instrument),' 'taekkyeon (traditional Korean martial art),' straw and Korean paper handicraft, and natural dyeing classes. The most popular program at the center is the traditional cooking class wherein participants get to make and try various traditional food items such as bean curd and rice cake. It's popular because the teachers/instructors use traditional recipes that many people think are fun to follow. Most of these are one or two-day programs and are participated in by groups of over 20 guests. Individual guests are also welcome to sign up for the program.
The Guestroom Building has 10 guestrooms, each furnished with television, refrigerator, air conditioner, dressing table, and hair dryer for the convenience of the guests. Men's and women's bathrooms and shower rooms are in a separate building because they are shared among the guests.

Poongnamheon is a traditional Korean house that was once owned by a Korean noble family and is located next to a 600-year-old ginkgo tree in Jeonju Hanok Village. Recently remodeled to serve as a guesthouse, it's popular among tea lovers because the owner of the guesthouse serves tea made from the tea leaves he cultivated and harvested in Jirisan Mountain. In addition to tea drinking, the guesthouse also offers a number of tea experience programs to the guests.
This traditional Korean house was built in 1934, and one of its outstanding features is the wooden columns that are more than 80 years old. It was a residential house until it was remodeled to serve as a guesthouse in 2004. Although a typical traditional Korean house with the wooden columns supporting the eaves at the end of the gambrel roof, it doesn’t have a “daecheong (open living room with wooden floor," which is common in traditional Korean houses. Instead, it has a wider “toenmaru (narrow wooden porch running along the outside of a room)” just outside the windows. The owner of the guesthouse saw to it that most of the original wooden materials and structures are preserved as much as possible when it was remodeled, in order for it to have the "feel" of a traditional Korean house owned by a noble family. The highlight of the house is the roof tiles, which are from Goryeong and made by Lee Geumbok, Intangible Cultural Heritage No. 121.
It took more than two years to remodel the interior of the building to bring out all the features of a traditional Korean house such as the floor, which is lacquered and covered with traditional Korean paper. The dark brown color of the floor is a perfect match with the wooden columns and ceiling rafters. As an antique collector, the owner of the guesthouse decorated all the guestrooms with some of his collection such as furniture. The old Korean paintings and folding screen add to the atmosphere of a traditional Korean house that could only be owned by a noble family in the past.
Guests can try fresh wild green tea leaves. The guesthouse owner originally came from Hwagae Jangteo in Jirisan Mountain, where he has a 16-acre wild green tea farm. According to him, the tea served at Poongnamheon is made from some of the best-quality tea leaves from the farm. As a tea lover, he takes pride in serving all-natural green tea to the guests.
The guesthouse owner and his wife also offer a number of wild tea experience programs to those interested in tea, such as "Tea Manufacturing Class” where guests get to roast fresh tea leaves and “Tea Food Tasting Session.”

Pungduck Old House is located in Oeam Folk Village.

Sancheong Yulsuwon was opened in October 2013 as traditional hanok accommodations to provide guests comfort and relaxation in nature. It was named after the expression from “Decade of Wen Wang” of the Classics of Poetry (the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry), meaning “Following the virtue of ancestors, one should cultivate one’s mind,” in the hope that guests can experience traditional Korean culture in hanok and learn common themes and cultivate virtues in life. Located at the hanok street in Sancheong County, Gyeongsangnam-do Province, Sancheong Yulsuwon is a hanok stay facility established by Korea’s major education company JEI Corporation. It was built by expanding and renovating the Old House of Suncheon Park’s Clan for over four years. It is not only a hanok cultural facility but also an educational facility that aims to provide visitors comfortable relaxation and to establish a sound, rich environment of educational culture, which is also the philosophy of JEI Corporation. It is located around the Dumulmeori area where Dangyecheon Stream and Sindeungcheon Stream -- the water branch of Hwangmaesan Mountain (1,108m above sea level) -- meet. The area is known for many houses of noble families situated in a propitious site combined with mountains and water and as a hanok village with the old stone wall, which was designated as a cultural heritage. Among them, Sancheong Yulsuwon is an outstanding hanok structure built on a total area of about 2,975m2 according to the theory of divination based on topography.
Entering the main gate Yeongsumun, one sees the Anchae (inner house) situated in front, the outer Sarangchae (detached building) on the right, and the bathroom on the left. Then, there are the inner Sarangchae, the kitchen, and the pavilion around the vegetable garden and the pond. The arrangement of buildings has special meaning: the kitchen signifies a green dragon (east), the bathroom, a white tiger (west), the inner Sarangchae, an Ansan (a low and small mountain in front of the house), and the outer Sarangchae and the main gate, a Josan (a high mountain behind Ansan); these five buildings seem to embrace the Anchae. As for the special names of the buildings, the inner Sarangchae built with the splendid style of semi-hipped roof and double eaves was named “Nongam,” meaning “a thatched cottage of a skilled farmer”; the outer Sarangchae was named “Goheon,” meaning “an old sarangchae,” and the Anchae -- named “Hagyejae” meaning “modesty” -- is situated in the innermost area. In particular, its upper floor (numaru) offers an open view of the environment. The bathroom, which was named “Seoljodang” meaning “one should keep the mind and body clean,” is composed of two connected houses. It is also equipped with red clay sauna and jjimjilbang (Korean dry sauna). 
Sancheong Yulsuwon was built based on a traditional hanok style of the Yeongnam area, with a splendid Seoul style of modernity added to the design. The sunshine comes through the windows made of hanji (Korean paper) in the clean and cozy rooms. Guests can also enjoy the outside view from the windows, which show the typical scenery of hanok consisting of jars, trees, flowers, and low stone wall with tiled roof. Every room is equipped with a bathroom including a bathtub and a modern-style kitchen. Sancheong Yulsuwon is adjacent to various tourist attractions including the following: valley of Daewonsa Temple surrounded by Geumgang pine trees; Namsa Yedamchon village, a village with an old wall made of red clay and stones; and Jeongchiwam Hermitage, Traditional Buddhist Temple No. 83 built by Silla’s Buddhist monk Uisang (625-702) and where the Buddhist Painting of Mountain Spirit can be found.

Each room is equipped with various amenities including TV, fridge, Internet, and air-conditioning. Guests can cook using the cooking equipment in the kitchen and hold a BBQ party in the courtyard.
Known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan, Gaesil Village was founded by the descendants of Kim Jong-jik (pen-name: Jeompiljae, 1431-1492), a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar of the early Joseon period who died during the Literati Purge of 1498. The head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62) and Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage Material No. 111), the old village school, are also situated in the village. In addition, the nearby Daegaya Museum displays the writing accessories of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 209). 
The village is also known as Gaehwasil, meaning “a beautiful valley with blooming flowers” as it is surrounded by a flower-covered mountain called Mt. Hwagaesan, a 350-year-old bamboo forest, and Jeopmubong Peak, which is said to resemble a fluttering butterfly. Over 80% of the village houses are traditional hanok buildings nestled amid a cozy environment. 
During the Campaign to Create Beautiful Communities conducted in 2001 and the Farm Experience Village Development Project in 2005, the village’s hanok were renovated or entirely rebuilt, earthen-stone walls were built, walking paths created, and refined landscaping works carried out, establishing the village in its current form. Furthermore, a village shelter, experience center, Internet café, and other facilities were built for the convenience of residents and visitors alike. In recognition of the villager’ efforts to revitalize their community, Gaesil was awarded the presidential citation at the Korea Rural Village Awards in 2011. 
Designated as a NongHyup’s Farm Stay Village in 2003, Gaesil operates a wide variety of hands-on experience programs relating to nature, agriculture, and local traditions, such as collecting sweet potatoes and rice planting; Korean traditional etiquette and tea ceremony; kite making and straw handicrafts; traditional food experiences such as yeot (Korean hard taffy) and yugwa (deep-fried sweet rice cakes); traditional games such as riding on a swing and neolttwigi (Korean see-saw); as well as loach fishing, ice sledding and so on. Gaesil Village, a representative farm stay village that “blooms” in every season, attracts around 50-60,000 visitors every year.|3|+82-54-956-4022 / +82-10-3207-4022|Seokjeongdaek House [Korea Quality] / 개실마을영농조합법인 석정댁 [한국관광 품질인증]|40165|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

The owner began to cultivate this place after hearing the concerns about the absence of a person who would inherit the tea culture of this region from a Buddhist monk he met at Iljiam Hermitage of Daeheungsa Temple in Haenam in 1996. Meanwhile, nine young men who studied tea together cultivated the green tea field in Haenam and built houses. After that, people who had affection for teas began to visit Seola Dawon. Since there were no decent accommodations for people who came from afar, they built eight Korean traditional-style houses in all including a Sarangbang made with stones, the earthen house, the wall-frame house, and the earthen bag house. The Korean traditional-style house was built in 2003 as a cultural space and later remodeled into rooms for the operation of Hanok Stay.|23|+82-61-533-3083, +82-10-7616-6129|Seola Dawon [Korea Quality] / 설아다원 [한국관광 품질인증]|59051|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Seonamseowon Confucian Academy or Gyeongsangbuk-do Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 79 is where the mortuary tablets of Mr. Kim Dae Yu and Park Ha Dam from the Chosun period are being kept. The mortuary tablets were moved to the current place in 1577 but the house was destroyed by the order of Heunseon Daewongun to demolish Confucian academies in 1868. The building has been rebuilt by descendants of Park Ha Dam in 1879. The more than 400-year old pillars and rafters are historical relics and Seonamseowon is being preserved as a place to display artistic practicality of Korean ancestors. There are five rooms altogether including Anchae, Small Sarangchae, Medium Sarangchae, Sarangchae (Deukwoljeong), and Gangdang. In particular, the roof of the Gangdang Daecheongmaru (big wooden floor) displays lotus-flower, Jusimposik, and Daposik structures. 
Jusimposik is a structure that the top of the pillar is directly supporting, a framed wood to fit the pillar as to support the weight of the tip of the eaves; Daposik, meanwhile, is framed wood in the space between the top of the pillar and the pillar as well. Such structures are hardly found in existing antique houses and highly valued in their historical sense. According to tradition, there is not any TVs, air-conditioners, computers, and refrigerators in the rooms of Seonamseongwon. Modern toilet and shower facilities are located outside the gate, whereas there are traditional toilet and tap water facility on the premise. In the Seowon garden are more than 400-year-old pagoda trees and more than 200-year-old crape myrtles. It is a place to feel the true beauty of traditional Korean antique house. The Ondol (floor-heating) Anchae room is pre-heated for guests who notify their arrival time in advance.

The name “Seoyusuk” means “a place to lodge in leisure" in Korean. The guesthouse is a small cluster of red clay houses with tiled roof situated below a hill with chestnut trees. It has a large grass yard with a flower garden, outside of which are flowers and earthenware jars for various traditional Korean sauces such as soy sauce, soybean paste, and red chili paste. Because the guesthouse is located in Boktan-ri, Sotae-myeon, Chungju, Chungcheongbuk-do where the water is so clean, no factories, or even restaurants, are allowed for the preservation of the natural environment. The owner of the guesthouse, who started the guesthouse business in 2010, says that she chose to live and work in a traditional Korean house because she has fond childhood memories of her family home, which was a traditional Korean house. It’s one of the reasons the guesthouse looks like an ordinary traditional Korean house built for a family. The guesthouse consists of a number of stand-alone buildings named “Byeolchae,” “Asojeong,” “Deogyeonjae,” "Jeongyeon,” "Gaonchae,” and "Suragan,” which all share the same yard. Among them, only the “Byeolchae,” “Asojeong,” “Deogyeonjae,” and “Jeongyeon” are used as a guesthouse. All the guestrooms look and feel different here, but they have the same red clay and pine wood finish. Even the walls are coated with natural dye. Thanks to these all-natural materials that emit far-infrared radiation with good health benefits, sleeping in one of these rooms can do your body good. Right in front of every room is a "toenmaru (a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of a room)” where you can sit and enjoy the view of the flower garden and the surrounding landscape.
Because all the guestrooms are in a stand-alone building, you can have some privacy during your stay both in and out of the room. The buildings have most of the features of a traditional Korean house except for the bathroom, which is modern and clean. The rooms are furnished with a kitchen, so the guests can cook during their stay. "Deogyeonjae Room" is the largest one and is perfect for families. It has only one bedroom, but there is a living room with a door between them. "Asojeong Room" has an octagonal roof with a natural wood column in the middle supporting the ceiling rafters. "Jeongyeon Room" is furnished with a bed, so it's the room of choice for families with a child. All the rooms are clean and cozy, with a large window offering a great view of the yard and mountain in the distance. BBQ facilities called “Suragan” are in one corner of the yard, where guests can enjoy barbecue even on a rainy day. On a clear day, you can also use the tables with a patio umbrella in front of each guesthouse. In front of the "Suragan" is a shelf of books for the guests to rent and read during their stay.
The most outstanding features of the “Seoyusuk” guesthouse are the cotton mattresses and blankets, which are naturally dyed, sewn, and embroidered by the guesthouse owner’s family. The sheets and blankets are not only flowery but also good for the health. Some guests even say that sleeping on the natural cotton mattresses and blankets in a red clay room actually eased their symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Even the curtains and tablecloths are made of the same natural cotton sheets. There is a 3,305m² flower garden across the grass yard, where you can see colorful wild flowers. The owner even built a "wondumak,” a Korean lookout hut on stilts that can usually be found in a melon field, in the garden for the guests to relax while enjoying the view of the garden and the landscape. Many of the guests stay here to pick chestnuts, because the entire village is literally full of chestnut trees. For this reason, guests staying at "Seoyusuk" in the fall, winter, and early spring are served sweet chestnuts. Because the guesthouse is close to Bakdaljae Pass and Gyemyeongsan Mountain, many people also come here to enjoy a stroll along the river. The guesthouse serves blueberry yogurt, organic salad, and porridge for breakfast (free for the guests) and offers an embroidery class where you can learn Korean embroidery and tea class where you can make tea with hand-picked and dried tea leaves.|11|+82-10-3477-8831|Seoyusuk [Korea Quality] / 서유숙 [한국관광 품질인증]|27306|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Cheongsong-gun in Gyeongsangbuk-do is a small village blessed with a spring flowing with natural mineral water, a beautiful valley with a majestic waterfall, and a mountain densely covered with pine trees. Thanks to this superb natural environment, Cheongsong-gun was designated as a 'Slow City' in 2011. Songjeong gotaek (The Old House of Songjeong) is located in the village of Deokcheon in Cheongsong-gun, which is one of the three richest and most prestigious families in the region. 
These three wealthy families are said to have produced millionaires for nine generations - from Sim Cheon-dae during the reign of King Yeongjo of Joseon (r. 17224-1776) to the 1960s. In particular, it was a seventh-generation grandson, Sim Ho-taek (pen-name: Songso), famous as one of the richest men in Joseon, who built Songso gotaek (Old House of Songso) along with three houses for his three sons, including Songjeong gotaek for his second son Sim Sang-gwang (pen-name: Songjeong) around 1880. As the Cheongsong Sim Clan has lived in the area for many generations, Cheongsong is known as the village of the Cheongsong Sim family. 
Covering a total area of about 10,000m2, Songjeong gotaek has a tall and grand front gate that symbolizes the wealth of the family. Upon entering by the gate, the large outer courtyard comes into view, followed by a gate connecting to the Old House of Songso on the right, and a walking path connecting to a well and a pine grove on the left. The square-shaped structure consists of a sarangchae (detached building), chaekbang (library), and daecheongmaru (main floored room). Passing through the entrance, there are the main building and the inner courtyard. Notably, the chaekbang has retained its original appearance from the time when it was used by Sim Sang-gwang. 
Although the house is very large, its interior is simply and modestly designed according to the virtues favored by classical scholars. The rooms are floor-heated in the traditional way (by ondol) using wood, decorated with traditional hanji (Korean paper), and equipped with traditional bedding. 
Songjeong gotaek offers visitors a variety of experience programs designed to promote the form of Korean classical music known as Gukak. It holds three major musical events each year including a pansori folksong program and a fusion gukak concert, attracting an audience of anywhere from 200 to 800 people to the courtyard of the house. Sometimes, families hold parties to celebrate their parents’ 60th, 70th, and 80th birthdays. 
The low hill situated behind the house has a quiet walking path.

'Suaedang Traditional House was built by Ryu Jin-geol, also known by his pen-name of Suae, in 1939. This hanok-style house consists of three buildings that measure 29-kan (a traditional measurement that corresponds to the space between two columns) in total. 
The main room, or jeongchim (7-kan at front and 2-kan at sides), has a half-hipped roof, and forms a‘ㄱ’-shape with the storeroom (10-kan at front), which also has a half-hipped roof. Originally located at 612 Sugok-dong, Andong-si, the house was relocated from a slight slope to a flat piece of land due to the construction of Imha Dam in 1987. Consequently, the Jeongchim was rebuilt at a lower level than before. 
The Suaedang was renovated by modernizing the old-style facilities including the kitchen, toilets, and washroom without changing their external features, while the rooms and daecheongmaru (main floored room) were decorated with red clay and natural paint. Suaedang, with its beautiful panoramic view of the lake, was designated as Gyeongsangbuk-do Cultural Property No. 56.

Overlooking the Suncheon Dongcheon near Suncheon South Market, Suncheon Guest House Nreem reminds us of 'the meaning of living slowly.' It is a recommended place to take a leisurely break. It is located midway between Suncheon Station and Suncheon Bus Terminal and is popular with young travelers.
The lobby on the first floor has recommended books and a place to sit down and read, while the underground cafeteria has a breakfast space; a kitchen that allows simple cooking; a bookcase filled with books; a board game room which is a good place to play with other guests; and a music facility where people can listen to cassette tapes and CDs. The guest rooms include a room for two-to-three persons with a single bed and a double bed; a dormitory for 4 persons; and a dormitory for 6 persons with a double deck bed.
Events such as chimaek (Chicken & Beer) parties are held frequently, which is expected because it’s a lodging house that hosts many young travelers, and it also organizes the first-come, first-served Yeosu Night Tours for guests. As there is a private garden right next to it, it is also a good idea to play with the dog that lives in the premises.
They take care of a discount coupon for entrance to Suncheon Bay National Garden, which is about 2 kilometers from Nreem.

'Located in Hongnae-dong, Suncheon, Suncheonman Bay Haeryongseong Fortress Gotaek is the head house of the Suncheon Moon clan and has long been inhabited by the descendants of Moon Wi-se (pen-name: Poongam), who rendered distinguished services to the Joseon dynasty as a Righteous Army during the Japanese Invasion in 1592. 
The house, with its long history of 300 years, was known as a wealthy and warm-hearted family house in the Suncheonman Bay area that used to provide a hearty meal for passers-by in the sarangbang (men’s quarters), and also produced three queens during the Goryeo Dynasty. 
As the house is surrounded by low hills where various seasonal herbs including mugwort, water parsley, and other medicinal ingredients grow, it offers guests a wild tea ceremony experience. It also offers a pork belly BBQ with water parsley in the evenings. Guests can see animals like roosters and Jindo dogs. In particular, the ‘Seungjiwon room’ consists of a bedroom, living room, bathroom, and kitchen, making it popular among family groups. <br>|11|+82-10-4205-1110|Suncheonman Bay Haeryongseong Fortress Gotaek (Old House) [Korea Quality] / 순천만해룡성고택 [한국관광 품질인증]|58026|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Suncheonman Minsok(Folk) Hanok Pension is located on a high plain overlooking Suncheonman Bay Ecological Park. It has been in business since 2012. Because it’s an old house that has been passed down through four generations and it may be uncomfortable for the guests to stay in, the house was renovated with five more guestrooms added in August 2013. The guesthouse was named by the owner's son, because the house has all the features of a traditional Korean house and commands a great view of Suncheonman Bay. The guestrooms are furnished with a modern bathroom, kitchen, TV, and air conditioner, but the floor is made of a thick layer of red clay using the traditional Korean floor heating system, which traps the warmth in the clay for a long time after being heated. The structure is built with Korean pine wood, which is good for your health and smells good too.
Located in the highest part of the village, the place commands a panoramic view of all the rice paddies and reed fields. In early winter, you can also see the migratory birds that are listed as a natural monument and black cranes feeding on the rice paddies. The Suncheonman Bay Ecological Park is only a 10-minute walk from the pension, so you can take a short walk to the park and enjoy the sunset on the Yongsan Observatory there. The natural landscape around the pension is a sight to behold in itself during the daytime, and the night view of the new town is also beautiful during the nighttime. There is a wooden deck in front of the pension where you can enjoy barbecue while taking in the night view. One of the best things about staying at this pension is that you can pick vegetables from the kitchen garden cultivated by the owner and his wife.
One of the reasons why this pension became popular is the food prepared by the owner's wife. Her food was introduced in the popular Korean TV show “Korean Cuisine and Dining” on the KBS channel, which introduced the family food of Jeollanam-do. All the dishes are made of all natural ingredients without any artificial flavors. The food is so good that some guests actually come here just for the food, without staying overnight. They say the dishes are nothing fancy, as all you will get is soup, grilled fish, and seasoned cockles, but they are some of the best you can find in the country. Her rolled omelete made of fertile eggs from the chickens grown by the owner is particularly popular among the regulars. The price for the food is very affordable as well.

The House of Soccer kkumnamu (The House of Future Soccer Player) of the Gaesil Village Farming Association Corporation is a hanok-style accommodation complete with a grassy field and a courtyard filled with well-kept flowerpots, creating a serene atmosphere around the hanok. The house has two Korean-style rooms with a capacity of two to four people. The Nansil room also has a kitchen. This cozy hanok is equipped with modern facilities for guests’ comfort and convenience, as well as the full range of amenities including TV, fridge, air-conditioner, toiletries, and table. Guests are permitted to hold a BBQ outside provided that they supply the charcoal themselves.
Known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan, Gaesil Village was founded by the descendants of Kim Jong-jik (pen-name: Jeompiljae, 1431-1492), a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar of the early Joseon period who died during the Literati Purge of 1498. The head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62) and Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage Material No. 111), the old village school, are also situated in the village. In addition, the nearby Daegaya Museum displays the writing accessories of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 209). 
The village is also known as Gaehwasil, meaning “a beautiful valley with blooming flowers” as it is surrounded by a flower-covered mountain called Mt. Hwagaesan, a 350-year-old bamboo forest, and Jeopmubong Peak, which is said to resemble a fluttering butterfly. Over 80% of the village houses are traditional hanok buildings nestled amid a cozy environment. 
During the Campaign to Create Beautiful Communities conducted in 2001 and the Farm Experience Village Development Project in 2005, the village’s hanok were renovated or entirely rebuilt, earthen-stone walls were built, walking paths created, and refined landscaping works carried out, establishing the village in its current form. Furthermore, a village shelter, experience center, Internet café, and other facilities were built for the convenience of residents and visitors alike. In recognition of the villager’ efforts to revitalize their community, Gaesil was awarded the presidential citation at the Korea Rural Village Awards in 2011. 
Designated as a NongHyup’s Farm Stay Village in 2003, Gaesil operates a wide variety of hands-on experience programs relating to nature, agriculture, and local traditions, such as collecting sweet potatoes and rice planting; Korean traditional etiquette and tea ceremony; kite making and straw handicrafts; traditional food experiences such as yeot (Korean hard taffy) and yugwa (deep-fried sweet rice cakes); traditional games such as riding on a swing and neolttwigi (Korean see-saw); as well as loach fishing, ice sledding and so on. Gaesil Village, a representative farm stay village that “blooms” in every season, attracts around 50-60,000 visitors every year.

Listed as Gyeongsangnam-do Cultural Property No. 178, it has higher stone walls than most other traditional Korean houses once owned by a noble family in the past. The village where this house is located can be easily found, since there is a road sign at the forked road with the Old Hakdong Stone Wall on the National Road toward Impo. Visitors to this site are advised to take a leisurely walk along the ancient stone walls instead of driving around them. This head house of Jeonju Choi Clan has been passed down to the eldest son of the family for 11 generations. With an area of 6,611m², the house consists of a room next to the main gate, the main building, a detached house with a wooden porch, a master bedroom used by the head of the household, and a small warehouse. The inner gate divides the house in half, each designated for male and female members of the household as was the tradition of the noble families in the olden times.|3|+82-10-3824-4724|The Old House of Choi Pilgan in Goseong [Korea Quality] / 고성 최필간고택 [한국관광 품질인증]|52956|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

The Old House of Ildu in Hamyang is the birthplace of Jeong Yeo-chang (1450-1504, pen-name: Ildu), a great Neo-Confucian scholar of the Joseon Dynasty. It is situated at the center of Gaepyeong Village, where many members of the Hadong Jeong clan and the Pungcheon Roh clan settled, in Jigok-myeon, Hamyang. The house is considered an invaluable historic material for studies on the architectural style of the 17th to 18th centuries and the history of the Joseon Dynasty. 
The house covers a total area of 9,917m2 and consists of the haengrangchae (servants’ quarters), sarangchae (a detached building used as a reception room for male guests), jungmunganchae (middle gate building), anchae (the inner house), araechae (outhouse near the gate), gobang (storeroom), shrine, gotganchae (warehouse), and a tall gate. Upon entering the house, visitors will notice an earthen wall that divides the sarangchae, which is built on a high foundation, from the other spaces so as to prevent visitors from looking inside the women’s spaces and shrine. The house’s most distinguished feature is the sarangchae, whose role and size were expanded, unlike other hanok houses at that time. The sarangchae was built in a “ㄱ”-shaped layout and is connected to the “ㅡ”-shaped jungmunganchae. Notably, the sarangchae’s numaru (attic, upper floor) is a well-designed library that attests to the scholarly spirit of Jeong. After entering via the Ilgagmun Gate (front gate with two posts and a roof), a middle gate comes into view. After passing this gate, there is the “ㅁ”-shaped anchae, or women’s quarters, with a courtyard. Then, after passing a room of the anchae, there is the gotganchae flanked by the shrine and the an-sarangchae. 
Currently, the house provides a variety of accommodation including four rooms in the haengnangchae, two rooms in the an-sarangchae, and three rooms in the sarangchae. The latter two are equipped with outside toilets. In particular, the sarangchae, as the core space of the house, offers an open view of Seokgasan Mountain from the numaru (upper floor) of the Takcheongjae Building. Although the house is designed and decorated with antique household objects, furniture and interior items, the toilets and bathrooms are modernized for guests’ convenience. 
As the Old House of Ildu has been designated as National Folklore Cultural Heritage No. 186, it is maintained by the local administrative office. However, Jeong Ui-gyun, an 18th-generation descendant of Jeong Yeo-chang, lives in a house in the orchard opposite the Old House of Ildu, and comes and goes constantly. Although cooking is not possible at the house, Jeong allows guests to have a garden party or cook in his large garden next to the detached building.

According to Korean feng shui, the village looks like an ox regurgitating in a comfortable crouching position. For farmers in the olden days, an ox was the symbol of prosperity and peace. This village has been regarded as one of the most fertile and prosperous areas in Korea. It was also the hometown of a famous scholar named Jeong, whose house now serves as a pension. The village has another name, “Hyo-ri,” which means "a village of devoted sons" in Korean, because the village was famous for having many devoted sons throughout generations. The pension is commonly called "Hyo-ri House" among the locals because the big house with a large field is regarded as the center of the village. The owner of the house transformed it into a pension in 2013, because he thought it would be nice to provide a comfortable place for visitors where they can just lie down on the wooden floor and look up the sky. There haven’t been many guests so far, but the owner says that his house can serve as a place where the guests can benefit from the good energy surrounding the village and learn history and culture during their stay. Guests are also welcome to pick vegetables from the field during their stay in the traditional Korean house and learn how the Korean scholars lived and studied in a farming family in the past.|20|+82-70-4257-4110, +82-10-5356-4116|The Old House of Jeong Clan in Woomyeong-ri (Hyo-ri House) [Korea Quality] / 우명리 정씨고가(효리댁) [한국관광 품질인증]|50017|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Situated beneath a low mountain in the southern area of Uiyang-ri, Chunyang-myeon, the east-facing The Old House of Mansan consists of a long haengrangchae (servants’ quarters, measuring 9-kan), a tall gate, a large courtyard, and a square-shaped bonchae (main building measuring 5 kan at the front and seven kan at the sides) in which the sarangchae (men’s quarters) and the anchae (women’s quarters) are connected. Unusually, the sarangchae faces east (it typically faces south), while the anbang (main living room) faces south. Consequently, the Jungmun Gate, the entrance to the anchae, faces north so as not to expose the anchae to exterior elements including cold winds. 
The sarangchae consists of a daecheong (main floored room) and a sarangbang room as well as a toetgan, a gamsil, a marubang (floored room), and a golbang (small room). The anchae, which surrounds the inner courtyard, comprises an anbang facing south, a witbang (upper room), and a ggumim marubang (floored room), which links to a warehouse, a kitchen, and a junggangbang (middle room).

“The Place Seoul” is located in a small alley in Gyedong-gil, Jongno-gu, Seoul. It is a guesthouse made by remodeling an 80-year-old traditional Korean house. The ondol room furnished with traditional beddings is popular not only among foreigners but also among Koreans due to its special ambience. The ceiling of the room dates back to 80 years ago. The rafter put on the roof at the time of construction of the house shows the antiqueness of the house. The toenmaru (a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of a room) that comes alive with the frequent coming and going of people adds to the ambience of the traditional Korean house, with the Sansuyu (corni) tree and vegetable garden beside the Korean-style house creating a leisurely atmosphere.   
Beyond being a mere place to sleep in, “The Place Seoul” aims to be a composite cultural space whose motto is “the place to fill.” A simple wedding or a small-scale performance is held in the garden during the day. The rooms can be rented for small meetings.

The Hanok was transformed into a new style of hanok by combining the traditional structure (built in 1975) with a modern hanok style. Located in Jeonju Hanok Village, this large hanok is composed of a ‘ㄱ’-shaped bonchae (main building, 7-kan*), a sarangchae (men’s quarters, 3-kan), a large courtyard, and a platform for crocks of sauces and condiments. The house accepts only a limited number of people so that guests can enjoy a relaxing stay amid a pleasant, spacious environment. 
Each room is built with “well-being” construction materials such as Hinoki cypress wood, red clay, and hanji (traditional Korean paper handmade from the mulberry tree). As for the four rooms of the anchae (women’s quarters), ‘Gwibin’, the largest room, is suitable for two families. It is heated with the ondol system (Korean floor heating system), and has a body massager and two king-sized beds. ‘Eoulim’ has an attic and a high ceiling with exposed rafters and crossbeams. Both rooms are equipped with two bathrooms. 
The ‘ㅡ’-shaped sarangchae opposite the courtyard has three guestrooms. In particular, ‘Byeolhana’ has a red clay bed with ondol heating; while ‘Byeolset’ features a bunkbed made of wooden materials originally used in the construction of the house. 
The Hanok provides a ‘Moonlight tea meeting’ where guests can enjoy tea and conversation under the moonlight in the large courtyard. 
*kan - a unit of measurement referring to the distance between two columns.

The house of Yehbon(예본의 집) is a guesthouse in a single-story residential house. The owner of the guesthouse has stayed at many guesthouses in the US while traveling and loved how they decorated the rooms according to the unique characteristics of the region. This is why she furnished the rooms with a traditional Korean cabinet inlaid with mother-of-pearl and other furniture that are more than 100 years old and covered with mantles that she herself embroidered. The antique furniture is one of the outstanding features of this guesthouse, which has two guestrooms, living room, kitchen, and two bathrooms. Many guests are from India, Canada, America, Netherlands, and Russia, including Koreans living abroad, and they say they find this place very comfortable. It's like homestay, but the owner of the guesthouse tries to provide enough privacy for those who wish to be left alone as well. It’s very conveniently located in Gangnam with access to public transportation within the vicinity and close to the subway station(3rd Daecheong station).<br>
I give my guests space but I am available when needed. Privacy is protected. You can always communicate with the host. The guests stay in the 1st floor, and the host lives in the 2nd floor. You can cook and enjoy a meal together in a spacious kitchen. You can take a shower but no bathtub in the bathrooms. It's very easy to find my place. Parking: Just next to the gate.

Kim Yeo-byeong was born as the fourth son of Kim Seong-gu (courtesy name: Oheon, 1641-1707), founder of Uiseong Kim's Clan at Baraemi Village in Bonghwa and who was a great-great-great grandson of eminent Neo-Confucian official-scholar Kim U-goeng (courtesy name: Gaeam, 1524-1590). The house is comparatively large, featuring a square layout with a lofty five-bay gate building (soseuldaemun) and the main house of seven bays. 

The main building (anchae) of the house, located against the backdrop of a pine hill, is believed to have been built over 400 years ago before the founder of the family arrived at the village. The family guesthouse (sarangchae) was renovated in 1876 by Kim In-sik (courtesy name: Amun, 1855-1910), who served as the caretaker (Chambong) of Sunghyejeon Shrine, and Grand Master Tonghun before founding Joyang School, which would later become the present-day Bonghwa Elementary School.

The name of the house, Tohyang, came from the courtesy name of Kim Jung-uk (1924-1967), a grandson of Kim In-sik. The latter was conscripted by the colonial authority ruling Korea at the time to serve the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo but fled during a military drill to become a freedom activist fighting against Imperial Japan in the Chinese cities of Suzhou and Hangzhou. He returned home after the 1945 Korean Liberation and studied in Jungang High School and Korea University before serving as a budget officer at the Economic Planning Board. The name of the house inscribed on the plaque hung under the roof of the gatehouse was written by his son Kim Jong-gu in honor of his life and achievements. 

At the front courtyard of the house is a lotus pond including barbecuing equipment and pottery kiln. In the rear garden is a folk playground with facilities and equipment for swinging, traditional Korean seesaw, shuttlecock-kicking, pitch-pot, and top spinning.

The front courtyard also features rustic ceramic pots and rooftiles bearing poetic passages written by the mistress of the house who is a prize-winning poetess. The house provides visitors with an opportunity to experience traditional Korean cultural heritage such as pottery, calligraphy, poetry, and traditional musical instruments. 

Rich with the heritage of traditional Korean culture and lifestyle, the Historic House of Tohyang guides visitors to refreshment and healing obtained from the legacy of the peaceful rural life of days gone by.|8|+82-10-8575-9036|Tohyang Gotaek (The Old House of Tohyang) [Korea Quality] / 토향고택 [한국관광 품질인증]|36236|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Uiseong Soudang House was originally built by Lee Ga-bal (pen-name: Sou) in the early nineteenth century. The house has the characteristic structure of a hanok, although its overall ‘ㅁ’-shape was modified into a ‘ㄷ’-shape after the small sarangbang was damaged by a typhoon few years ago. The house features a moderately high foundation stone and moderate construction materials, corresponding to traditional Confucian principles. However, entering the side door in the west, one can see a different aspect of the house.
In general, the gardens of hanok built during the Joseon period didn’t have a fence in order to preserve the natural environment, but they often had a small pavilion next to a small stream. However, thanks to the founder’s wealth, Soudang House featured a new style of garden in which a separate house with a wall and a pond was built and sun trees from China were planted. 
The byeolchae (separate house) is focused on its role as a residence, having several rooms, unlike others that are usually emphasized on its maru (wooden floor). It is thought that the main users of the byeolchae were the owners rather than male guests. 
Recently, work on the interior of the byeolchae was completed to accommodate guests. The anchae and sarangchae have also been renovated with modern bathrooms and toilets for guests’ convenience.

Ungidaek House of the Gaesil Village Farming Association Corporation is distinctive for its red clay exterior. This cozy hanok comprises two rooms: Juksil, which accommodates 6 people, and Maesil, which is suitable for 4 people. Each room is decorated with white wallpaper and a red clay floor sheet, and is equipped with TV, air-conditioner, toiletries, hairdryer, table, and other amenities. Each room has an ensuite bathroom and cooking equipment.
Known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan, Gaesil Village was founded by the descendants of Kim Jong-jik (pen-name: Jeompiljae, 1431-1492), a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar of the early Joseon period who died during the Literati Purge of 1498. The head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62) and Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage Material No. 111), the old village school, are also situated in the village. In addition, the nearby Daegaya Museum displays the writing accessories of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 209). 
The village is also known as Gaehwasil, meaning “a beautiful valley with blooming flowers” as it is surrounded by a flower-covered mountain called Mt. Hwagaesan, a 350-year-old bamboo forest, and Jeopmubong Peak, which is said to resemble a fluttering butterfly. Over 80% of the village houses are traditional hanok buildings nestled amid a cozy environment. 
During the Campaign to Create Beautiful Communities conducted in 2001 and the Farm Experience Village Development Project in 2005, the village’s hanok were renovated or entirely rebuilt, earthen-stone walls were built, walking paths created, and refined landscaping works carried out, establishing the village in its current form. Furthermore, a village shelter, experience center, Internet café, and other facilities were built for the convenience of residents and visitors alike. In recognition of the villager’ efforts to revitalize their community, Gaesil was awarded the presidential citation at the Korea Rural Village Awards in 2011. 
Designated as a NongHyup’s Farm Stay Village in 2003, Gaesil operates a wide variety of hands-on experience programs relating to nature, agriculture, and local traditions, such as collecting sweet potatoes and rice planting; Korean traditional etiquette and tea ceremony; kite making and straw handicrafts; traditional food experiences such as yeot (Korean hard taffy) and yugwa (deep-fried sweet rice cakes); traditional games such as riding on a swing and neolttwigi (Korean see-saw); as well as loach fishing, ice sledding and so on. Gaesil Village, a representative farm stay village that “blooms” in every season, attracts around 50-60,000 visitors every year.

White Village, located on the banks of Daehwanggang River, boasts of wonderful views in a natural environment. The scenery around the river changes picturesquely every season against the background of the mountains and the sky: light green trees and cherry blossoms in spring; cool water play in summer; dazzling tinted leaves in autumn; and snowy scenes in winter. The environment is so clean that one might encounter wild ducks, elks, or even an otter while walking around the accommodation. If you enjoy fishing, it is a great idea to take your tools in the Daehwanggang River. The Daehwanggang Trail is also close to White Village. Including paths around mountains as well as ones around the river, the trail takes about 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete and is mountain bicycle-friendly (MTB), about 1 km-long stretching from the Amnok Recreation Area to the Seomjin River. Major attractions in Gokseong such as Seomjingang Train Village, Taeansa Temple, and Jo Tae Il Poetry Memorial Hall are about 15-20 minutes away by car. The Zipline, which opened recently opposite the Gajeong Station, is only about 3 4 minutes away.

As one of the two most widely known traditional Hanok villages in the Gyeongsang-do area, the other being the famous Hahoe Village in Andong, Namsa Yedamchon of Namsa-ri in Sancheong has also been dubbed one of Korea's most beautiful villages with the breathtakingly beautiful landscapes of Jirisan Mountain surrounding it. As its name Yedamchon ("village with old walls") suggests, the village is famous for the walls about 3.2 kilometers long in all surrounding traditional Korean houses called Hanok. These walls, which symbolize the "nobility and propriety of Confucian thinkers in the past," are now designated as Registered Cultural Heritage No. 281.The village has many valuable cultural properties, nine of which are inscribed in the list of heritage protected by law, including the Historic House of the Choe Family (Gyeongnam Cultural Material No. 117) and the Historic House of the Yi Family (Gyeongnam Cultural Material No. 118) as well as walls enclosing the houses in the village. Designated as a "theme village" focusing on traditional rural life, Namsa Yedamchon provides visitors with a variety of programs designed to help them experience farm village life, traditional folk games, tour to historic houses, and village school life in the past. Located at the heart of Namsa Yedamchon, the Historic House of the Choe Family  features the layout of the traditional homes owned by Confucian scholar-officials in the south of the Korean Peninsula during the Joseon period. The house is characterized by an imposing figure with high and beautifully decorated walls enclosing its premises as well as an exceptionally tall gatehouse (soseuldaemun) and a 230-year-old plum tree standing in the courtyard. The family that had called this house their home originated from the head family of Jeonju Choe's Clan based on the Historic House of Choe Pil-gan in Hangnim-ri of Goseong, Gyeongnam.The main building (anchae) of this house was completed in July 1920, and the family guesthouse (sarangchae), in September of the following year. Other buildings, including the wings of the main gate, storehouse, and cowshed, were also built around the same time. These buildings are arranged to form a square layout with the main building placed at the center of the rear part and two "middle gates" flanking the guesthouse. At the western middle gate is a wall called Naeoedam ("in-out wall"), which was built to keep the main building and gate wings from the visitor's eyes according to the Confucian teaching that preferred dividing a space into two, one each for the male and female members of a family. The main building of the house has a six-bay by three-bay structure with wooden-floored verandahs (toenmaru) front and back, hip-and-gable roof supported by five main beams, and lofty ceiling and raised foundation. It consists of the main bedroom, two subordinate rooms, a kitchen, and a wooden-floored central hall, all furnished with beautifully decorated windowed doors. The guesthouse features a similar layout, a five-bay by three-bay structure covered with hip-and-gable roof consisting of two rooms on each side of the central wooden-floored hall and a "pavilion hall" (nugakbang) with raised floor. The building is placed on the foundation built by piling hewn stones, and it has a superstructure supported by round columns. The gatehouse is a four-bay by two-bay structure facing east, with a wooden-floored hall open to the south, a bedroom, and a pantry. The storehouse on the east of the house is a five-bay by two-bay building with two rooms -- one large and the other small, used for the storage of grains and farming equipment, respectively -- and a treadmill. In 2014, the Historic House of the Choe Family was selected as an Outstanding Hanok. The house has been extensively renovated by the owner, the eldest grandson of the Choe Clan's head family, to provide three modern guest rooms -- two in the family guesthouse and one in the gatehouse -- all furnished with clean toilet, TV, air conditioner, Wi-Fi system, and refrigerator. The house also provides a variety of programs including folk games to help its guests have an exciting cultural experience. <br>

The name “Wolindang” means “The place where the moonlight meets the chimney smoke over the forest" in Korea. It was named as such because the locals make sure the structures are in perfect harmony with the surrounding nature. With comfortable rooms and various things to do in nature, it's a great place to stay for a family vacation.
Wolindang is situated on a hill overlooking the plain. There, you will see Wolchulsan Mountain to the east, Eunjeoksan Mountain to the west, and the fields in the northern part of the village. The village is most well known for its beautiful moonlight, particularly when it cascades down from the peak of Wolchulsan Mountain. It's one of the best places in the country to see the full moon throughout the four seasons. Even the guestrooms are named after the natural features of the village, such as “Mountain Sunset” where you can enjoy the beautiful sunset, “Crescent Moon” where you can feel the calm of the moonlight, and "Plain" where you can enjoy a panoramic view of the plains. There are Oriental paintings by Baek Seungdon and Kim Seungnam in each of the rooms, and that's why the rooms are collectively called "The Wolin Museum" among the locals. As you take a walk in the village, you will see many murals, which are the paintings of the 12 different landscape views seen from Wonpungjeong Pavilion at the end of the village. The murals include some poems written by the villagers.
In 2005, the owner of this place moved back to this village, his hometown, and built this traditional Korean house in a large vegetable garden right below the house where his family has lived since the time of his great-grandfather. The house has all the features of a traditional Korean house, including the “numaru”, main floored room, flat stone floor, and red clay walls. The “numaru” and “toenmaru” in particular are great places to enjoy the wind and see the clear sky. Guests can enjoy a meal or tea in the "numaru" located next to the “Plain Room”. The flat stone floor is designed for floor heating from the kitchen furnace, just like the rooms in a house were heated in the past. The kitchen furnace can be used as a BBQ or to cook sweet potatoes. The floors in the room are covered with traditional Korean paper and furnished with starched sheets and blankets. There are a number of programs with nature as the theme for the guests to enjoy as well, such as the “Tea Drinking Experience” program where you get to make and drink your own green tea and yellow tea in the traditional Korean way and “Natural Dyeing Experience” where you can dye your own handkerchief or T-shirt using natural materials such as persimmon, safflower, and tree. Other programs include the cooking class where guests get to make knife-cut noodles with adzuki beans and Korean wheat dough. There is a volleyball court in the grass yard. These traditional experience programs and the large grass yard are two of the main reasons why large families choose this place to stay overnight. As such, this is one of the most recommended guesthouses for families with children or old parents planning for a trip.|17|+82-61-471-7675, +82-10-6648-7916|Wolindang [Korea Quality] / 월인당 [한국관광 품질인증]|58433|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Designated as Folk Material No. 17 in recognition of its value as a historic material, it is the largest and best preserved noble house in Gyeongsangnam-do Province, and is currently managed by Park Jeong-ja, the wife of the eldest son of the head family. It was originally opened to the public for the annual Keochang International Festival of Theater (KIFT) as there was insufficient accommodation to lodge the thousands of visitors to the festival. Therefore, the county suggested that Park provide people with a hanok&nbsp;accommodation to promote the village’s traditions. Accepting the suggestion, Park renovated the house by expanding the sarangchae room installing a modern-style washroom, and providing clean high-quality bedding. The house itself consists of seven structures in total including the anchae, sarangchae, jungmunchae, gotganchae, a tall gate, and a rear gate. Both the sarangchae and anchae have a half-hipped roof. Notably, the sarangchae has a total area of 99m2 and features a large girder and a round foundation stone. This traditional hanok house also boasts high-quality, refined interior decoration.  The Geochang area is well known for both the Suseungdae scenic point, whose splendid surroundings include pure crystalline water, rocks, and a pine grove, and the Keochang International Festival of Theatre (KIFT) which is held every summer. After passing the main gate of the Suseungdae scenic point, in Whicheon-myeon, Gaochang-gun, and continuing along the road, visitors will come to Hwangsan Village, where a 600-year-old-zelkova tree welcomes them. In addition, visitors can enjoy the mural paintings created as part of a public art project by Geochang County while walking along the 1.2km-long stonewall (designated as a Gyeongsangnam-do Folk Material). The village of Hwangsan consists of two districts, one of which contains about fifty 100- to 200-year-old hanok houses, as well as Wonhak Goga, which has stood at the center of the village for about 500 years. Wonhak Goga, or the Old House of the Shin Clan, was originally built by Shin Gwon (pen-name Yosu), but was then demolished and rebuilt by Shin Jong-sam, a 10th-generation descendant of the family, in 1927. It is also a renowned family house and has remained a symbol of the family’s wealth and authority for many generations. Park’s father-in-law, Shin Do-seong, was a member of the National Assembly and worked as the Ministry of Unification, while her husband, Shin Wi-beom, worked as a school juristic person, gaining people’s confidence and trust. Furthermore, the house stands in an auspicious location in terms of geomantic principles, according to which the family’s descendants will have a peaceful and prosperous life for the next 400 years. Park hopes that guests will enjoy their stay amid the serene atmosphere of this old hanok house. <br>|2|+82-10-5359-2224|Wonhak Goga (Wonhak Old House) [Korea Quality] / 원학고가 [한국관광 품질인증]|50103|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Yangchamsadaek (Yangdongho’s former name) or National Cultural Property No. 152 is a traditional hanok accommodation. Dalasil Village, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, where the house is located, is a town with traditional houses and fields, where interestingly those who have the surname of Jeju Yang live together.
Yangchamsadaek is a typical noble's house in the southern region with the ㄷ-shaped main building and the ㅡ-shaped detached building form the ㅁ shale. It is expected that the main building was built in the 18th century and the detached building at the end of 19th century. In 2013, the current owner has taken over the antique house and started running a hanok stay, and his daughter, Jo A-ae, a curator and culture planner, added modern touches to turn it into a culture complex, Hanok 152. The wide lawn is sometimes rented for music performance, traditional wedding, or outdoor wedding, and other times it serves as a venue of one-day classes for hanbok experience, Korean food experience, etc.
As for rooms, there are four options: big room and small room in Anchae (main building), and Daecheong room and bed room in Sarangchae (detached building). The rooms are decorated with traditional cabinets and folding screens with embroidery, displaying the beauty of an antique house. The main floor, which is much bigger than that of other houses, has been renovated by the owner. The main floor in the main building, with a comfortable sofa and a rug, is modern and luxurious, whereas the main floor in the detached building is cozy with a floor table and Korean cushions. Toiletries are not available in the bathroom but provided upon request to the information desk. Space rental is also available.

Now used as a cultural space, the house attracts many people looking for relaxation and cultural experiences. 
Yangsajae, meaning “a house (jae) that cultivates (yang) classical scholars (sa)”, was an annex of the Jeonjuhyanggyo Confucian School where classical scholars used to study in preparation for the national civil service examinations. As an educational and creative place, Lee Byeong-gi composed sijo poems there for six years from 1951. It later served as the Jeonbuk Public Elementary School with the introduction of new learning to the Jeollabuk-do area in 1987. Since 2002, however, it has served as a hanok stay dedicated to promoting local history and traditions to the public. It is said that the building was constructed on a 400-year-old site about 150 years ago. In 1980, repair work was conducted to save the basic structure of the house. 
The house is a typical ‘ㄱ’-shaped hanok structure with a half-hipped roof. In particular, the three dormitory rooms originally used by Confucian students and classical scholars can be converted into one single room for seminars, tea ceremonies, or other group meetings simply by opening the bunhapmun (sliding doors). 
The guesthouse is a ‘ㅡ’-shaped hanok built in 1980. Each room has a clean and cozy interior with simple decoration and furniture. The rooms include the Gudeul (floor heated with firewood) Room, where the tea ceremony program using green tea leaves picked from the wild green tea field behind the house is held, and the Ondol (Korean floor heating system) Room. 
As the poet Lee, who loved orchids, poems and alcohol, lived at Yangsajae, there are still traces of his former presence inside the house. Notably, Lee used the ‘Garamdasil’ room as his study room, so it displays some of his photos. 
There is a postbox situated in a corner of the yard which the guests can use, and the owner will deliver the mail himself. Yangsajae is not only a hanok accommodation but also a multi-experience space where guests can discover traces of the old educational institute and the poet Lee’s life and works.

The name means "A home for a happy trip," she says. It’s a unique guesthouse since the owner offers various traditional educational games. The cozy and comfortable guesthouse is a traditional Korean house built in March 2013 at a site where an old house used to be. The main building and detached building are divided by the ridge of the roof with beautiful rafters. There is another meaning to the name of the guesthouse: "a house where the woman is happy." She named it as such for a good reason. She used to live in Seoul when her parents advised her to move to Jeonju and run a guesthouse, leaving her husband and child behind. At first, she considered accepting only female guests, but it wasn't an option since most of the people visiting Jeonju are couples and groups of friends. Instead, she made sure the guesthouse is safe for women while building the house. Many female tourists traveling alone find this a great feature of the guesthouse because they feel safer during their stay. For one, she installed three doors for the rooms (1 transparent door, 1 opaque glass door, and a traditional Korean door). Not only do the guests feel safer; the rooms are also well-insulated thanks to the triple doors. The floors and walls are covered with traditional Korean paper coated with soybean oil, which is very environment-friendly.  
In the four rooms named “Spring,” “Summer,” “Autumn,” and “Winter,” there are many toys and materials for traditional Korean cognition games, such as “Chilgyo Game,” “Gonu Game,” and “Mabangjin.” It’s very likely that even Koreans have never heard of these games. The owner of the guesthouse chose these games specifically because they are perfect for children to play in a traditional Korean house. She teaches her little guests how to play the games. “Chilgyo Game” involves making a shape with 7 to 20 pieces, whereas “Gonu Game” is similar to the game of Chinese chess. "Mabangjin" is a type of IQ game that involves laying down a total of nine different numbers in three rows and columns so that the sum of the three numbers is identical when added horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Many guests find these games interesting, and the owner of the guesthouse finds joy in teaching these games to as many families as possible. She recently took over another traditional Korean guesthouse called "Samrakheon" near the Jeonju Oriental Medicine Center. It's a stand-alone guesthouse for groups and families, and she uses the place to teach traditional games to more people.|12|+82-63-231-3040, +82-10-7742-6738|Yeohangga [Korea Quality] / 여행가 [한국관광 품질인증]|560-070|B02|B02|B0201|B02011600|

Located in the village of Gaesil in Hapga-ri, Ssangnim-myeon, Goryeong-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, the Old House of Yeonpung is an historic 150-year-old house, and was formerly the anchae (the inner house) among the four structures built by the current owners’ ancestor, who served as the governor of Yeonpung-hyeon, Goesan-gun, Chungcheongbuk-do. The house was restored after being bombed during the Korean War, and is currently is used to accommodate visitors or for village events.
The Old House of Yeonpung is situated behind Hwasanjae Pass, which is the traditional wedding experience site of Gaesil village. It is considered a propitious site according to geomantic theory as there is a bamboo forest to its rear. During restoration work in 2010, the large anchae, which covered about 2,644m2, was renovated into a modern structure with four rooms. 
In particular, the Juksil and Maesil rooms are very large, making them ideal for families and groups. A separate building with a large courtyard and a BBQ facility is available for guests who want to cook or have a barbecue. The charming courtyard comprises a well, a bench, and various flower trees.
Known as the village of the Seonsan Kim clan, Gaesil Village was founded by the descendants of Kim Jong-jik (pen-name: Jeompiljae, 1431-1492), a leading Korean Neo-Confucian scholar of the early Joseon period who died during the Literati Purge of 1498. The head house of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Folk Material No. 62) and Doyeonjae (Provincial Cultural Heritage Material No. 111), the old village school, are also situated in the village. In addition, the nearby Daegaya Museum displays the writing accessories of Kim Jong-jik (Provincial Tangible Cultural Heritage No. 209). 
The village is also known as Gaehwasil, meaning “a beautiful valley with blooming flowers” as it is surrounded by a flower-covered mountain called Mt. Hwagaesan, a 350-year-old bamboo forest, and Jeopmubong Peak, which is said to resemble a fluttering butterfly. Over 80% of the village houses are traditional hanok buildings nestled amid a cozy environment. 
During the Campaign to Create Beautiful Communities conducted in 2001 and the Farm Experience Village Development Project in 2005, the village’s hanok were renovated or entirely rebuilt, earthen-stone walls were built, walking paths created, and refined landscaping works carried out, establishing the village in its current form. Furthermore, a village shelter, experience center, Internet café, and other facilities were built for the convenience of residents and visitors alike. In recognition of the villager’ efforts to revitalize their community, Gaesil was awarded the presidential citation at the Korea Rural Village Awards in 2011. 
Designated as a NongHyup’s Farm Stay Village in 2003, Gaesil operates a wide variety of hands-on experience programs relating to nature, agriculture, and local traditions, such as collecting sweet potatoes and rice planting; Korean traditional etiquette and tea ceremony; kite making and straw handicrafts; traditional food experiences such as yeot (Korean hard taffy) and yugwa (deep-fried sweet rice cakes); traditional games such as riding on a swing and neolttwigi (Korean see-saw); as well as loach fishing, ice sledding and so on. Gaesil Village, a representative farm stay village that “blooms” in every season, attracts around 50-60,000 visitors every year.

Known as the Hero of the Silla Kingdom, General Kim Yusin was the great grandson of King Guhae, the last king of the Geumgwan Gaya Dynasty, and the son of Seo Hyeon, a great general of the Silla Kingdom. Yusin joined the Hwarang (aristocratic youth military corps) at 15 and began dreaming of ways to unify the peninsula’s three kingdoms. <br><br>Kim Yusin gained his political foothold by establishing a strong relationship with nobleman Kim Chunchu and made a name for himself through his valor on the battlefield.<br><br>

When Kim Chunchu eventually succeeded to the throne as the 29th king of the Silla Kingdom (changing his name to King Muyeol), Kim Yusin rose through the ranks and was eventually promoted to the extraordinarily high-ranking position of Sangdaedeung in the year 660 (7th year of King Muyeol’s reign). Kim Yusin then went on to defeat the Baekje Kingdom in cooperation with the Tang dynasty, also later conquering the Goguryeo Kingdom in the year 668.<br><br>

The Tang dynasty turned against Silla after the collapse of Goguryeo, but was defeated by Kim Yusin’s army in cooperation with the armies of Goguryeo and Baekje. With the fall of the Tang, Kim Yusin finally realized his dream of unifying the three kingdoms and was appointed the highest government post in Silla in honor of his heroic achievement.<br><br>

The tomb of General Kim Yusin is a large tomb measuring roughly 30m in diameter. The relief carvings of 12 Oriental zodiac gods (half man, half animal) stand guard around the tomb, brandishing weapons. The elaborately decorated tomb is second in grandeur only to those of royalty, further underscoring Yusin’s major contribution in unifying the three kingdoms.
<br>

<br>The path to this tomb is also a sight not to be missed. The street leading up to the tomb is called Heungmu-ro, and has been selected as one of the 100 Most Beautiful Streets in Korea. The street is full of cherry blossoms in spring and is famous for being a great place to take a walk or go for a drive.|2|+82-54-749-6713|Gyeongju Tomb of Kim Yu-sin (경주 김유신묘)|38058|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

The fortress takes after its name, which, literally translates to mean 'a crescent moon shape on top of a hill'. The famous history books of Samgukyusa mention that Silla’s 4th King Seoktalhae (AD 57~80) thought this area was an ideal spot for the fortress and bought the land from a nobleman.  The 2nd King Namhae (AD 4~24) impressed by Seoktalhae’s actions, took him in as his son-in-law, later, becoming the 4th king.  The area was then under Silla’s rule for 900 years, the last king being the 56th, Gyeongsoon (AD 927~935).  
<br>

<br>
Although the magnificent grandeur of the palace is now just an empty lot, it has been told that this area was filled with imperial buildings during the Silla dynasty.  Currently, the region of Wolseong has a freezer made out of rocks called Seokbinggo, an archery range, horse-riding field, and a traditional playground, which resembles the grounds of the Joseon Period (the dynasty that ruled the Korean peninsula from 1392-1910).|2|+82-54-779-6100|Gyeongju Wolseong Palace Site (Banwolseong Fortress) (경주 월성(반월성))|38172|A02|A02|A0201|A02010200|

There are 15 summits on this mountain, of which Cheonhwangbong (845.1m) is the main. Several others include the peaks of Sambulbong, Sinseongbong, and Gwaneumbong.

Sambyeolcho was a military unit of the Goryeo Dynasty. When the Goryeo dynasty 
made peace with the Mongolian forces in February 1270 (the 11th year of King 
Wonjong), the Sambyeolcho special defense unit opposed it and launched a resistance movement. They moved their base to Jindo in Jeollanam-do but after suffering a huge defeat, they moved to Jeju-do 
and built Hangpaduseong Fortress. They continued to fight  against the Mongolian forces for two more 
years there. However, all the members were killed in April 1273 (the 14th year of King Wonjong).<br> <br>This 
independent anti-Mongolian movement was born out the deeply patriotic belief 
in the need to safeguard the nation from  foreign invasion.

It was first built in 1716 as Anjabyeolmyo Shrine by An Gyeong-sin, An Gyeong-in, An Gyeong-jeong, and An Gyeong-sang, who are the 15th descendants of An Hyang, and memorial services have been held there every year  on March 3rd and September 9th on   lunar calendar. In 1843, the shrine was renamed Haposeowon. The shrine was demolished upon the order of regent Daewongun during the reign of King Gojong.<br><br>

Later, An’s descendants rebuilt the shrine in Haposa Temple to perform memorial services for An Hyang. In 1931, additional buildings were constructed while descendant An Bae-ho held discussions with Confucian scholars about rebuilding the shrine.

He took with him ten books on the Analects of Confucius and a book of Cheonjamun, a text of one thousand Chinese characters. Over time, he earned the trust of the emperor and became instructor to the crown prince. Wangin is well-known for his part in the development of Japanese culture and his name appears often in Japanese history. Wangin educated beyond textbooks and made great contributions to the development of arts, crafts and music and is revered as the originator of Japan’s Asuka culture.<br><br>

Hongneung is the mausoleum of the 26th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, Emperor Gojong (1852-1919, reign 1863-1907), and his wife Empress Myeongseong (1851-1895). <br>
 <br>
 <b>Hongneung</b> was first the tomb of Empress Myeongseong, and it was located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. When Emperor Gojong died, he was buried together with the previously deceased empress and the tomb was moved to its current place. <br>
 <br>
 Emperor Gojong was the second son of the regent Heungseon Daewongun and ascended to the throne at the young age of twelve. In 1897, he declared Korea to be the “Daehan Empire” and established himself as the emperor. However, under unrelenting pressure from Japan, he signed the Eulsa Treaty, and as a result, the Daehan Empire was deprived of its diplomatic rights. In 1919, Emperor Gojong died in Deoksugung Palace at the age of 67. <br>
 <br>
 Empress Myeongseong became the empress in 1866. However, at that time, Korea was actually governed not by Emperor Gojong, but by his father, who was controlling things from behind the scenes. In 1873, when Emperor Gojong began to administer state affairs, Empress Myeongseong exercised considerable power and deeply participated in political affairs. Her diplomatic policy was in obvious favor of Russia. This angered Japan, and she was killed by Japanese assassins. <br>
 <br>
 <b>Yureung </b> is both the last royal tomb of the Joseon dynasty and the tomb of the first Korean emperor. It is the tomb of Emperor Sunjong (1874-1926, reign 1907-1910), the 27th ruler of the Joseon dynasty, his first wife Empress Sunmyeonghyo, and his second wife, Empress Sunjeonghyo. Emperor Sunjong was the second son of Emperor Gojong and Empress Myeongseong. He was the last ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, and he struggled to defend the dynasty during that era of turbulence. <br>

 Empress Sunmyeonghyo died when she was still the crown princess. She was originally buried at the foot of Yongmasan Mountain. After Emperor Sunjong died, the tomb was moved to its current location, and the emperor was buried alongside Empress Sunmyeonghyo.  Empress Sunjeonghyo became the second wife of Emperor Sunjong at the age of twelve. It is known that she concealed the Imperial Seal when Japan put pressure on the Joseon dynasty to sign the Korea (Joseon) -Japan Consolidation Treaty in 1910. However, the treaty was concluded, and the Daehan Empire came to an end after being deprived of its sovereignty. Empress Sunjeonghyo is said to have maintained her dignity right up until the moment she died. She was the last empress of the Daehan Empire. <br>

 Hongneung and Yureung look different from other royal tombs. When the name of the country changed from the Joseon dynasty to the Daehan Empire, the rulers of Korea were called emperors. Therefore, the tombs of the two emperors were modeled after the tomb of the Ming dynasty’s ruler, King Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang). Surrounding Hongneung and Yureung are statues carved in the shape of animals such as giraffes, elephants, and lions, which can’t be seen at the other royal tombs of the Joseon dynasty. The stonework of Hongneung tomb was made in a traditional way, while the stonework of Yureung tomb shows a more realistic and advanced technique.|9|+82-31-591-7043|Hongneung & Yureung [UNESCO World Heritage] (남양주 홍릉과 유릉 [유네스코 세계문화유산])|12238|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

It was named so because the leaves turn so crimson that the water of the valley reflects the color and appears crimson as well. This is the place where Chi-Won Choe, after returning from Dang China to Silla (BC 57-AD 935) found Korea in disarray. It was too much to bear for him so he retired to live privately with poetry until his death. 
<br><br>
There are 19 famous places in Hongryudonggyegok Valley, including major cultural assets like Jongsangjeong Pavilion, Nakhwadam, and Bunokpok. The scenery of Nongsanjeong Pavilion, where Chi-Won Choe read poetry and played baduk, is especially beautiful.  On the opposite side is a rock where you can see the handwring of Chi-Won Choe. The Yongmunpokpo Falls, located on the north end of the valley, has beautiful scenery with its harmonious blend of falling water and Giamgoiseok (fantastic rocks and stones).  
<br><br>
The scenery of Hongryudonggyegok Valley changes every season, and it is the finest part of Gayasan Mountain. It is famous for the azaleas in full bloom during the spring, and for the thousand-year-old pine trees and broad-leaved trees growing thickly throughout the valley and the cool, clear water that runs through it during the summer. In the fall, the nearby pine tree forests and broad-leaved trees tinge in color and accentuate the crimson foliage of autumnal leaves, making the crimson reflection of the leaves in the valley water look like a rising flame, and shows why the valley was named Hongryudonggyegok Valley.|21|+82-55-930-8000|Hongryudonggyegok Valley (홍류동계곡)|50201|A01|A01|A0101|A01010900|

Oseosan Mountain brings flowing fields of silver grass every autumn. The fields stretch across the entire mountain and are the inspiration for the annual Silver Grass Festival in October. Situated halfway up the mountain, Jeongamsa Temple’s small size is common for rural villages, but its unique location draws many visitors year-round.<br><br>

There are few existing records that mention the temple’s beginning. Some suggest that it was built around AD 527 during the 5th year of King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (‘Detailed Survey of Korean Geography’ published during the late Joseon dynasty). It states Jeongamsa Temple's location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baekwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Geongamsa Temple is located approximately 11 kilometers to the east of Gyeolseonghyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>
Nonetheless, some foundation stones measure 70-80 centimeters on each side. These stones indicate the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five <em>kan</em> (Korean unit of measurement indicating the space between two pilars) at the front and three kan on the side. Future archaeological studies will help identify the true history of Jeongamsa Temple.|15|+82-41-641-0488|Hongseong Jeongamsa Temple (정암사 (홍성))|32285|A02|A02|A0201|A02010800|

The winding road leading to the attractions offers a perfect sencery of the mountains and cliffs, as well as magnificent fall foliage in autumn. Sign posts are installed along the way to each of the sceneries to prevent tourists from getting  lost.
<br><br>
[Scenic Beauty 1] Hwaam Mineral Spring<br>
At Hwaam Mineral Spring, water rises up through a rock crater located in Dong-myeon, Jeongseon. The water is said to be good for stomachaches, eye infections, and skin diseases; and, as it contains nine essential elements such as calcium and fluorine, it tastes crisp and clean. 
<br><br>
[Scenic Beauty 2] Turtle Rock <br>
Part of the path leading to Hwaam Mineral Spring is buttressed by a cliff, on which there is a rock that resembles the shape of a turtle. <br> <br>

[Scenic Beauty 3] Yongmaso<br>
With its clean water and wide sheets of rock, Yongmaso Lake is a popular attraction for vacationers. <br><br>

[Scenic Beauty 4] Hwaamdonggul Cave<br>
Hwaamdonggul Cave used to be a gold mine that was commercially operated from 1922 to 1945. The nation’s 5th largest goldmine was, however, found to have natural stalactites, and later the cave was developed as the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800㎡ and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters. The entire area consists of 5 chapters, which in turn constitute 41 zones; it takes about an hour and a half to see all of the zones. <br><br>

[Scenic Beauty 5] Hwapyoju Cliff<br>
Hwapyoju is a cliff facing the entrance of Hwapyo-dong, which can be seen on the way from Hwaam-dong to Molundae. The cliff may appear as if a giant sharpened a large sheet of rock and placed it upright, or less imaginatively, as if two pillars are standing side by side. 

<br><br>
[Scenic Beauty 6] Sogeumgang River<br>
The four-kilometer stretch from Hwapyoju to Molundae, surrounded with 100 to 150-meter high rock cliffs and thick forest, is called Sogeumgang River (small Geumgang River), meaning that its beautiful scenery is reminiscent of that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan 
Mountain.<br><br>

[Scenic Beauty 7] Molundae Cliff<br>
Molundae literally means ‘the cliff beyond which clouds disappear’. The tip of the steep cliff is adorned with three specimens of 500-year-old pine trees. Legend has it that gods would perch on the cliff’s top and enjoy the beautiful view. At the foot of the cliff lies a large sheet of rock that can accommodate hundreds of people. 
<br><br>
[Scenic Beauty 8] Gwangdaegok Valley<br>
Gwangdaegok Valley is said to be the mysterious place where heaven, earth and clouds meet. The surrounding hills are very rough and bumpy, which makes the area a renowned mountain in Korea. There is a belief among wild-ginseng diggers that they can find great ginseng if they pray in Gwangdaegok, so it is a popular attraction for such prospectors.|11|+82-33-560-2363|Hwaam Tourist Attractions (Hwaam Eight Scenic Sites) (화암관광지(화암8경))|26116|A02|A02|A0202|A02020200|

The flood control dam has proved its worth during the floods of 1995, 1996, and 1999 and it has become a major tourist destination over the years. Located In the vicinity of Peace Dam is Bimok Park, which is the origin of the famous national song “Bimok.”
<br><br>
In addition to the war monuments inside the park, there are around a dozen wooden crosses with rusty iron helmets placed on top within the barbed wire entanglements around the hill, thereby reminding visitors of the national tragedy of the Korean War. The county of Hwancheon hosts the Bimok Cultural Festival from June 3 to June 6 every year at Bimok Park, Bungeoseom Island by the town’s riverside, and the surrounding areas. The four-day festival offers a variety of events such as song contest, memorial ceremony of poetry reading, bimok tree cutting contest, rice ball eating contest, army life experience, military music parade, and more. 
<br><br>
Crossing over to Yanggu County from Peace Dam, there is a national security education place comprised of attractions like the 4th Underground Tunnel and Eulji Observatory. Paroho Lake Battlefield Tourist Park is also worth a visit after looking around Peace Dam. Also known as the “ocean within mountains,” Paroho is a manmade lake created as a result of Hwacheon Dam constructed in 1944. The lake is home to over 70 different species of freshwater fish such as mandarin fish and carp. It also holds a sorrowful history of burying at sea a whole three divisions of the Chinese Forces in defending the lake during the Korean War. The name Paroho, meaning “enemy breaking lake,” was given after the late president of Korea Rhee Syngman visited the place and designated a plaque in his own handwriting in memory of obtaining victory in fierce battle. There is an observatory, a security hall, and a stone monument engraved with the poetry of Wolha Rhee Taegeuk (1913-2003).|17|+82-33-440-2575|Hwacheon Bimok Park (화천 비목공원)|24110|A02|A02|A0202|A02020700|

It was constructed in the fifth year of King Jinheung’s reign (544) during the Silla Era, but was burnt down during the Imjin War (1592-1598). Including the main building Daeungjeon, the temple was rebuilt during the Joseon period. <br>
 The path to the temple lies along the valley named Hwaeomsa Temple Valley. It also takes you to Nogodan Plateau of Jirisan Mountain. With Korean traditional straw-roofed houses and a water mill, you can find a cozy place named Siuidongsan, which means the Hill of Poetry. <br>
 Beyond this area is the main gate of Hwaeomsa Temple, Iljumun Gate, and a long stonewall. Entering the main gate, you can find Geumgangmun Gate and the stairs going up to Bojeru. At the top of the stairs, there are the main building Daeungjeon and Gakhwangjeon Pavilion. <br>
 <br>
 Also, Seoocheung Pagoda (west-five-story pagoda) and Dongocheung Pagoda (east-five-story pagoda) are at each side of the front yard. In front of Gakhwangjeon Pavilion is the largest light made of stone in Korea. In addition, there are many national treasures here including the Sasaja Samcheung (3-story) Stone Pagoda, which is situated at the hill called Hyodae. The main building Daeungjeon and Bojeru is magnificent and graceful.

It was built in 1522 AD (the seventeenth year of the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon dynasty) by monk Shinwol, but was destroyed in a fire in 1618. In 1866 (the third year of the reign of King Gojong), it was rebuilt through financial support from his royal elders. <br><br>
The temple was built in an early architectural style and has Daeungjeon, a main sanctuary (Tangible Cultural Asset No. 65), Myeongbujeon shrine, Samseonggak pavilion, Cheonbulobaekseongjeon shrine, a temple bell pavilion, Bohwaru tower, and Hakseoru tower.<br><br>

If you head down south a bit from the beach, you will also find a few villas in the midst of the woods.

It is designated Gangwon Provincial Monument No. 10 with a circumference of about 16 km, and it has a wide reed field which is an important place for migratory birds and swans in the winter. Hwajinpo Lake is surrounded by evergreens and white sandy beaches; it is a lagoon where the river and the sea meet.  Materials drifting down the river deposited at the bottom of the river become a sandy beach that eventually block off the river from the sea, creating a lagoon. Hwajinpo Lake is the largest lagoon near the East Sea, and has many ancient artifacts around it, such as the Ten Goindol rocks (also called Jiseokmyeo) scattered around the lake. Because of its excellent scenery, Kim Il-seong (1912-1994) of North Korea and the South Korean president Rhee Syngman (1875-1965) had summer houses here after the independence of Korea in 1945.

The rites were first performed in the Goryeo Dynasty by King Seongjong in the first month of 983 (2nd year of his reign), but was repeatedly adopted and abolished, and eventually stopped at the start of the Joseon Dynasty. <br><br>Then in 1456 (2nd year of King Sejo), the practice was temporarily standardized and the rites were performed at Wongudan (Hwangudan) Altar again in 1457. However, rites were again abolished in 1464 (10th year of King Sejo). It wasn’t until 1897 (34th year of King Gojong) when the Joseon Dynasty was renamed the Korean Empire and King Gojong ascended to emperor, that the rite was revived. 
<br><br>
Now, Hwangungu Shrine and three stone drums stand at the location of the former altar complex. The three stone drums symbolize the instruments used for the rites. The shrine was completed in 1899, two years after the altar was started in 1897. Today, the Hwangungu Shrine still stands within the hotel grounds of the Westin Chosun Hotel.|24|+82-2-3396-5882|Hwangudan Altar (환구단)|04533|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

The fortress, constructed from 1794 to 1796, was built as a display of King Jeongjo’s filial piety towards his father and to build a new pioneer city with its own economic power.
<br><br>
The fortress wall stretches for a total of 5.52km and has a great variety of military facilities that are hard to find anywhere else. Four gates face each of the cardinal directions—Janganmun (north), Paldalmun (south), Changnyongmun (east), and Hwaseomun (west)—and the seven-arch style Sumun gates straddle the point where the nearby stream reaches the palace. Above the Sumun gates is a pavilion called Hwahongmun.  
<br><br>
Hwaseong Fortress was constructed under the guidance of Yu Hyeong-Won (1622-1673) and Jeong Yak-Yong (1762-1836), and is believed to have been constructed very scientifically. The fortress wall was built using Seokjae and Jeondol (bricks) and the holes between the bricks are just big enough to fire guns, arrows, or long spears through in case of an attack. 
<br><br>
During construction of the fortress Jeong Yak-Yong invented ‘Geojunggi,’ which uses a ‘hwalcha’ (lever) to lift up heavy stones, greatly reducing construction time.  
<br><br>
The Suwon Hwaseong Fortress went through many turbulent times and damage, and in the battle of June 25th, many of the facilities became so damaged that they were deemed irreparable. Even though the fortress restoration initiative (1975-1979) restored many of the sites to their former glory, Paldalmun to Dongnamgakru (an area 491 meters in length) has still not been renovated.  
<br><br>
The fortress was designated as Historic Site No. 3 in January 1963, and in December 1997, it was designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site. A variety of performances and events are held at the fortress every day and Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival takes place here in autumn.|13|+82-31-290-3600|Hwaseong Fortress [UNESCO World Heritage] (수원 화성 [유네스코 세계문화유산])|16253|A02|A02|A0201|A02010200|

The island was revealed when seawaters were blocked during a land reclamation project. As a sedimentary layer formed during the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era (dated around 83 million to 85 million years ago) was eroded by weathering, around twenty 50-60 cm diameter nests and roughly 130 dinosaur eggs ranging in size from 11 to 14 cm, located at six to seven sites, were discovered. It is anticipated that more fossils will be discovered once a thorough investigation is carried out and more land is reclaimed.
<br><be>
Most dinosaur eggs are oval shaped and dark red. Considering the properties of the fossilized shells, the eggs that have been discovered so far are assumed to belong to four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs with a long neck and tail, and two-legged herbivorous dinosaurs, including the Hadrosaur. A wide range of plant fossils were also discovered alongside the fossilized eggs, leading to expectations that the formerly lush environment may yet be restored.
<br><br>
The discovery of the Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site in Hwaseong has greatly expanded the scope of Korean paleontology; previous paleontological discoveries were exclusively limited to fossilized dinosaur footprints. This significant discovery has attracted many internationally renowned scholars who have visited the site in Hwaseong. The site is closed to individuals in order to preserve its integrity. But, you can visit the area by joining the fossil site exploration programme offered by a locally operating environmental group.|31|+82-31-357-3951|Hwaseong Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site (화성 공룡알 화석지)|18235|A01|A01|A0101|A01010500|

In addition to being used as a shelter during war, King Jeongjo also stayed here during trips to worship at his father's tomb.

This site was originally the location of Garyangsa Temple, which was constructed in 854, the 16th year of King Munseong of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was very famous as it was surrounded by beautiful mountains and crystal clear waters.  However, the temple was destroyed by fire during the Byungjahoran (the second Manchu invasion of Korea). <br><br>
During the Joseon dynasty, King Jeongjo moved the tomb of his father to this spot, and built Yongjusa Temple here to pray for the repose of his father’s soul.  It is said that one night before the temple was completed, King Jeongjo dreamt of a dragon ascending to the sky holding a magic ball in its mouth. He therefore named the temple “Yongjusa”, which means the temple of a dragon with a magic ball in Korean. 
<br><br>
The courtyard of the temple contains the Bronze Bell of Yongjusa Temple, National Treasure No. 120; a stone pagoda; Daeungbojeon (the main hall); and Cheonboru Pavilion. Visitors to Yongjusa Temple can also find the “Bumoeunjunggyeong” books, which were written by King Jeongjo on the subject of filial affection and respect for one’s parents.

After he lost his mother, he built the pavilion to mourn at her grave while still being able to see his father’s grave in Gaeseong to the North. His brother-in-law, then Minister of the Interior, Gang Sa-deok named the pavilion “Hyosajeong,” which means pavilion of filial piety.
 <br><br>
In order to find the original location of the pavilion, poems by Jeong Inji and Seo Geojeong and an old map of Korea “Sin-jeung-dong-gunk-nyeo-ji-seung-nam” were referenced, but the pavilion was not found because the surrounding landscapes had changed much. As a result, a location was selected and the pavilion was reconstructed at its current location. The house is 3 kan* in the front and 2 kan* on the side. The roof is a hip-and-gable roof. The pavilion has one room with under floor heating and a railing around the pavilion

The burial ground covers an area of more than 18,520 square meters and is officially listed as Historical Site No. 347. To date, a total of eight tumuli have been excavated, all of which are chamber tombs. <br><br>

Surprisingly enough, the tombs were first discovered in 1986 by a high school student. While digging for arrowroot, a young man from a local high school found some pieces of gold that resembled a hat. He quickly notified the authorities and it was soon discovered that the pieces of gold were in fact valuable ancient artifacts. An emergency excavation was conducted and the eight tumuli were uncovered, but unfortunately all of the tumuli except Tomb No. 1 had been severely damaged. Tomb No. 1, which is still in relatively good condition, boasts an entrance measuring an impressive 16 meters in x_height and 2 meters in x_width. <br><br>

Inside the tombs archaeologists found valuable relics from the Baekje dynasty including earthenware, jewelry (a gilt-bronze hat, gold earrings, glass beads, etc.), harnesses and ironware. Given the shapes and the types of the pieces found, historians estimate that the tumuli were built in the 5th century. Since the gilt-bronze hat is similar in shape to those found in Japan, experts believe that there was an active exchange between the Baekje people and the people of Japan.|9|+82-63-859-5875|Iksan Ipjeomni Ancient Tombs (익산 입점리 고분)|54501|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

At the time of the survey it was discovered the tombs had already been illegally excavated, most likely during the reign of King Chungsukwang of the Goryeo Dynasty. Though looters had stripped the tombs of any burial accessories, the wooden coffins were found to be relatively intact. <br><br>

The coffins were severely damaged in the aftermath of the Korean War, but were later restored by the Jeonju National Museum. When they were first found, the twin tombs measured 3.1 meters high and 0.5 kilometers wide, but some of the original wood was lost during the tombs’ tumultuous history and the restoration that followed. The larger of the restored tombs now measures 30 meters in diameter and 5 meters in x_height while the smaller tomb measures 24 meters in diameter and 3.5 meters in x_height. On January 21, 1963 the tombs were designated Historic Site No. 87. <br><br>

The Twin Tombs are roughly 200 meters apart, with the tomb in the east called Daewangmyo (big royal tomb) and the one in the west Sowangmyo (small royal tomb). The interiors of the tombs are done in the same style as the stone chamber tombs found in the tomb cluster of Neungsan-ri, Buyeo. Considering that the nearby Mireuksaji Temple Site was built during the reign of King Mu of Baekje Dynasty, it is highly likely that the Twin Tombs are those of King Mu and his wife, Queen Seonhwa.|9|+82-63-859-5792|Iksan Ssangneung (익산 쌍릉)|54573|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

Bodhi-Dharma, a great monk from the south of India, practiced seated Zen meditation for 9 years at the Sorimsa Temple located deep in Sungsan Mountain in China. In his honor, Sungnimsa Temple (a Buddhist temple of the same sect) was named after the mountain (‘Sung’) and the temple (‘Rim’ or ‘Nim’) where the Dharma lived.

The Bridge of Freedom, which South Koreans crossed when they came back to their mother country from North Korea after the signing of the Armistice Agreement, stands behind Mangbaedan 
Alter.

This stone fortress was designed as a place to launch attacks against enemies. One of the ways in which those in the fortress fended off intruders was to unleash the water from the giant fortress well and let it gush down the mountain towards the oncoming forces.<br><br>

The fortress wall is about 2.5m high and 3.5m wide and has a ditch 7-8 meters that runs alongside the southern wall. Compared with other Korean fortresses, Imjonseong Fortress is higher and about 2 meters thicker. It is the largest fortress of the Baekje Kingdom and has become the subject of much research.<br><br>

History shows that the fortress was the central hub of the Restoration Movement of the Baekje Kingdom (18 BC - 660 AD). In the 20th year of the reign of King Uija (Baekje dynasty), the kingdom was defeated by the united forces of the Silla Kingdom and the Tang dynasty (currently, China). Boksin (a cousin of King Uisa), a monk, and Heukchisangji stayed at the fortress for three years while trying to return the king to power.<br><br>

As you walk along the winding trail, you’ll be able to see Daeryeonsa Temple and as you continue to the top, you’ll be treated to spectacular views of Oseosan, Baekwolsan, and Gayasan mountains.

The eastern foot of the mountain has many scenic spots with its distinctively cozy and tasteful atmosphere, and the northern area called Mugye-dong also offers beautiful scenery. Inwangsa Temple was established in the early Joseon period (1392-1910) to guard the national palace Gyeongbokbung. The temple is comprised of 11 shrines from five different Buddhist orders. The unique design of each shrine adds pleasure to hikers on their way up to Seonbawi, an unusual rock formation that is a site of many folk beliefs and shamanist rites.|23|+82-2-737-4434|Inwangsa Temple (인왕사 (서울))|03023|A02|A02|A0201|A02010800|

Many people enjoy hiking from the path that begins at the Sajik Tunnel, which leads to the peak of the mountain passing the fortress walls, then hike back down to Buam-dong. The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located in the Gyeongbokgung Palace but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center. 
<br><br>
The hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from a top <em>beombawi</em> rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200m and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.<br><br>

The view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past. 

The inner wall path also leads to the Tangchundaeseong Fortress. Tanchundaeseong Fortress was built in order to reinforce the capital’s defenses after the Japanese invasion in 1592 and the Manchu war of 1636. 
<br><br>
Inwangsan Mountain stands at a x_height of 338.2m and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu.

Every year, about 8.7 million people from Korea and abroad visit this fascinating island that measures 73 kilometers across, east to west, and 31 kilometers, from north to south.<br>
Jeju Island earned the UNESCO triple crown, being designated as a World Natural Heritage, Global Geopark, and Biosphere Reserve as well as one of the Seven Wonders of Nature. The climate of Jeju is quite different from the temperate climate of mainland Korea. Since the island has a subtropical climate as well as a subarctic one, there are many peculiar plants that can only to be found on this island. The unique sight of Jeju Island captivates travelers. The scenery that represents this volcanic island of Jeju, such as Jusangjeolli Cliff (the pillar-shaped joint on the beach) were created by Hallasan Mountain and Oreum (parasitic cones in Jeju dialect). The piedmont area that visitors encounter on their way from the beach to Hallasan Mountain is a gift of nature and the piedmont area on the way to Geomun Oreum, where Jeju World Natural Heritage Center is located, is worth seeing. Another unique aspect here is the Jeju dialect and lifestyle.<br>

Traveling the 182 kilometer circuit road along the coastline by car, motor scooter or bike is recommended. There is a trail for walking called “Jeju Olle-gil” for those who choose to make a round trip on foot. Jeju Island is implementing more discretionary and diversified policies in politics and economy as well as tourism, and this is what makes Jeju worthy of the name “free international city.”|No sigungucode|+82-64-740-6000|Jeju Island Special Tourist Zone (제주도 관광특구)|63208|A02|A02|A0202|A02020200|

The land was purchased by French Priest Baudenet in 1891 (28th year of King Gojong), but construction of the church did not begin until 1908. The church was designed by Priest Poinel, who also designed the famous Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Construction was completed in 1914, a time during which Korea was under Japanese rule. Though originally built just outside of Pungnammun Gate, the site of the martyrs, the church was later moved to its current location for expansion.  <br><br>

The first Romanesque building in the Honam region, the Jeondong Catholic Cathedral is made of gray and red bricks and bears a striking resemblance to the Myeongdong Cathedral in Seoul. Not only considered one of the most beautiful Catholic churches in Korea, some even go so far as to say it is one of the most beautiful structures in all of Korea, citing the church’s unique combination of Byzantine and Romanesque architectural styles. The rectangular building is topped with three Byzantine bell towers (to the right, center, and left) and boasts arched ceilings, several of which meet in the form of a cross. <br><br>

It is interesting to note that some of the bricks used in construction of the church were made using materials from the Jeonjueupseong Fortress, which was torn down by the Japanese.

Naejangsan Mountain is about 11 kilometers away from downtown Jeongeup, and its name means "many secrets in the mountains." The highest peak of Naejangsan Mountain is Sinseonbong Peak, which is 763 meters above sea level. The nine peaks of the mountain stand in a circle, similar to the shape of a horse’s hoof. As one of the eight scenic views of the nation, it boasts grand scenery. Geumseongyegok Valley, which embraces Geumseonpokpo Falls, Dodeokpokpo Falls and Baegamgyegok Valley, is also famous. <br><br>
Since there are more than ten trekking courses, hikers can choose a course after taking their physical stamina or personal preference into consideration. The length of each course varies from 1.5 to 14 kilometers. For those who are not able to trek long distances, walking the 3.6 kilometer-long nature trail that leads to the flatland is a good option. Visitors can reach the observation platform easily by riding a cable car from the ticket office.<br><br>
The number of tourists has been steadily increasing since the KTX train began to stop at Jeongeup Station. When the autumn colors are at its peak in particular, taking the KTX makes the trip to Naejangsan Mountain much easier for travelers, and prevents  traffic jams. The Donghak Peasants Revolution Commemoration is held in May and the Naejangsan Fall Foliage Festival  takes place in October. <br><br>

King Sejo visited Onyang Hot Springs and Songnisan Mountain in 1464 to cure an illness. While passing under this tree, he looked up and saw that his royal sedan chair was about to be ensnared in the tree’s branches. As he called for his bearers to look out, the branches suddenly lifted for the royal procession to proceed. On his way to Seoul, King Sejo was also able to take shelter from a rain shower under this tree.

Unfortunately, most of the temple buildings have been destroyed and only the main hall, Daeungjeon Hall, and a few smaller structures such as the living quarters remain on site today. The temple was originally called Ssanggyesa Temple because the waters of two valleys meet in front of this temple. It was renamed Jeongsusa Temple during the latter part of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1905).<br><br>The temple was reportedly established by the state monk Doseon-guksa in the first year of the reign of Silla Kingdom’s King Aejang (800). However, the temple’s founding year preceded the monk’s year of birth so there seems to have been a mistake in the year of foundation. Daeungjeon, the main hall, has three rooms in the front and two on the sides with a gambrel roof.

There are 735 traditional Korean hanok houses. While the rest of city has been industrialized, Hanok Village retains its historical charms and traditions.

<br>
Jeonju Hanok Village is especially beautiful for its unique roof edges, which are slightly raised to the sky. Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, Anchae and Sarangchae. Sarangchae is where the men dwell, and is referred to as the Seonbi room. Because men and women had to remain separate, Anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet.  
<br>
<br>
Another trait of hanok is that all the houses are heated with ondol, a unique sub-floor heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated. One hanok in particular has been set aside so that tourists can experience traditional Korean life, called Hanok Life Experience Hall. You can enter the rooms to experience the warm floor first-hand.

Jindo Island has some legends which are still popular today, especially that of “Old Woman Bbyong of Hoedongri.” A long time ago, there were many tigers on Jindo Island. When tigers began appearing frequently in the village, the people fled to Modo Island. In the process, only the old woman Bbyong ended up remaining on the island, so the lady prayed everyday to Yongwang, the god of the ocean, to let her see her family again. Around February, Yongwang appeared to her in her dream and said, “I will send a rainbow to the sea tomorrow; ride it and cross the ocean”. The next day old woman Bbyong went out to the sea and prayed again, and the seawater parted as the rainbow road appeared.  Through this road, her family and the other villagers came back to the island. Therefore when the sea parts, the people celebrate this phenomenon by holding the Yeongdeung Festival to remember the Old Woman Bbyong.

The city of Goryeong played such a central role in the development of the confederacy that many artifacts and historic sites of the Daegaya period can still be found there today. <br><br>

Some of the most prominent landmarks are the 200 gobuns (ancient tombs) that lie along the southeastern slope of Jusan Mountain in Goryeong. In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>



Historical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>



To continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong. The exhibition hall depicts the social structure of the era through ancient customs such as burying servants alive with their dead masters.|3|+82-54-950-6363|Jisandong Ancient Tombs (고령 지산동 고분군)|40140|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

Joseon-era Confucian scholar Toegye Yi Hwang (1501-1570) was inspired by the 
scenery of the valley and the enchanting sound of the flowing water, so he came 
up with names for each of the nine sections of the valley and collectively called 
them Jukgyegugok (nine bamboo valleys). The valley presents a splendid sight 
indeed with crystal clear waters, lush forest, and white rocks. In summer, vacationers 
from around the country flock to Jukgyegugok Valley to cool off from the sweltering 
heat by dipping their feet in the refreshing waters of the valley. Famous tourist 
attractions near the valley include Sosuseowon Confucian Academy, Buseoksa Temple, 
and Eupnaeri Mural Tomb.<br><br>
* Choamsa Temple<br>
On the path that ascends from Jukgyegugok Valley, there is a small temple 
located at the foot of Sobaeksan Mountain. The great monk Uisang Daesa of the 
Silla Kingdom reached this place during his search for an ideal site to build 
a Buddhist temple invoking national security. He set up a small thatched hut 
for a temporary stay until he found the most propitious spot, on which he built 
Buseoksa Temple. In the site where his thatched hut once stood, he built another 
temple and named it Choamsa Temple. The original structure was destroyed by 
fire during the Korean War (1950-1953). The temple has been restored to its 
present state by the Buddhist monk Lee Bo-won after years of arduous efforts.|14|No tel|Jukgyegugok Valley (죽계구곡)|36012|A01|A01|A0101|A01010900|

It is a man-made pond that was dug out in August 1720 and completed in October of the next year. The pond has been used as a source of water for agricultural use as well as for drinking water. Even though it is small in size, about 100 meters long, 50 meters wide and 7 to 8 meters deep, the pond has never dried up from any drought.
<br><br>
While the surrounding thick woods of Juwangsan Mountain are quite an impressive place for those who love nature, 30 willow trees which are 150 years old are rooted in the pond, which make a fantastic balance with the surroundings, creating a picturesque scenery found nowhere else.
<br><br>
The beauty of this forest along with the nature surrounding it culminates when the shadows of the trees elongate on the still waters of the pond. Words cannot express the magnificent view of the surroundings here with the water, trees, and fog altogether. 
<br><br>
The best season to visit Jusanji Pond is spring and fall. People say the best time to go is when spring buds start to appear in April and May, or when the autumn foliage is in full bloom. In the summer, much water is drained for agriculture, so the area feels empty, and in the winter, the reservoir is frozen and it is not possible to see the trees reflected on the water. 
<br>

<br>
Jusanji Pond is located in the inner part of Juwangsan Mountain, which, unlike the outer part of Juwangsan Mountain where hiking courses are more developed, had been considered as a hinterland because of its inaccessibility and steep mountains. It started to become known to the general public about 20 years ago as photographers came looking for beautiful landscapes. 
<br>

<br>
Even though the movie set was dismantled for environmental and management reasons to prevent water contamination, numerous visitors continue to visit a place that has preserved nature and its wild habitat.|21|+82-54-870-6111|Jusanji Pond - Cheongsong UNESCO Global Geopark (주산지 (청송 국가지질공원))|37438|A01|A01|A0101|A01011700|

Mageumsan Hot Springs rises 200 meters above sea level, contains a slightly alkaline enriched water of 55℃ or more, and consists of over 20 mineral substances including natrium, radium, manganese, ion sulfate, and others.  Mageumsan Hot Springs are known to be effective in helping arthritis, women's diseases, neuralgia, depression, etc., and are frequently visited by travelers.
<br>

<br>
Records of  Mageumsan Hot Springs are listed in the ancient texts of King Sejong's Geographical Book, Survey on Civilization (Dongguk-yeojiseungnam), and more, illustrating that these hot springs were of great importance in ages past. The hot springs were temporarily closed in the later period of the Joseon Dynasty but were reopened by a man named Tokunaga from Japan. Later, Jin-Il Sohn, a resident of the area took ownership of the hot springs. 
<br>

<br>
Outstanding scenery complements the hot springs with  Cheonmasan Mountain (370m), Mageumsan Mountain 
and  Baekweolsan Mountain (400m) located nearby. In particular, there is a legend that surrounds Baekweolsan Mountain 
and people like to climb this mountain and then relax by bathing in the hot springs.|16|55-298-4400|Mageumsan Hot Springs (마금산원탕)|51101|A02|A02|A0202|A02020300|

Perhaps because of such a shape, this temple was never damaged by any major wars during the Joseon period (1392-1910). It is most beautiful during the spring time, when the cherry blossoms, sansuyu, and magnolias fill the whole area.  
<br>
Two eye-catching sights at Magoksa Temple are the Five-story Stone 
Pagoda and the Chinese juniper trees scholar Kim Gu (Korean politician and freedom activist) is said to have planted. The top of the Five-story Stone Pagoda is decorated with bronze.

Sut Maibong (alt. 667m) is said to be the male peak while the slightly larger Am Maibong (alt. 673m) is deemed the female peak. In the early Joseon Period the mountain was named ‘Sokgeumsan,’ but began to be called ‘Maisan’ after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled a horse’s ears (‘maisan’ meaning ‘horse ears’). All along Maisan Mountain, you will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‘tafoni,’ are of great academic value. <br><br>

Inside Hwaeomgul Cave, you’ll find medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year. It is widely believed that once you drink the water, especially on the days of the Spring and Autumn Equinox, you will soon have a son and be blessed by the mountain spirit. Even today, many women who have difficulty conceiving visit the mountain to pray to the mountain spirits for their heart’s desire—the gift of a child. The region in which Maisan is located is the birthplace of many talented people and national heroes, which some say is proof of the blessings of the mountain and its extremely powerful spirit.|14|+82-63-430-8751|Maisan Hwaeomgul Cave (마이산 화엄굴)|55450|A01|A01|A0101|A01011900|

When he awoke from his nap, he noticed that snow had completely covered his nearby surroundings except for the exact spot where he lied down, which remained so warm that snow had melted and steam was rising from the ground.

The dish is both spicy and refreshing, using fish with simple flavors, but adding plenty of spices to the broth. Monkfish is also full of vitamin A, making it good for the skin, as well as having little fat and helping with digestion. The vegetables mixed into the broth contain vitamin C, making this spicy dish very healthy.<br>
 <br>
 Masan Agu-jjim Street got its start in the mid-1960s, around the area of Odong-dong. Shop-keepers who generally sold jangeo-guk (eel stew) began to create something similar to bukeo-jjim (steamed pufferfish), using monkfish instead of the usual pufferfish. This new creation, agu-jjim, was easy enough for the locals to adjust to, and soon many people were ordering it. From just one shop, the dish has spread into over 20 shops on this street selling agu-jjim.<br>
<br>
There are many variations from the original agu-jjim. Now you can also enjoy dishes such as Agu-tang (Monkfish soup), agu-suyuk (boiled monkfish dish), agu-stir-fried seafood, and agu-bulgogi.|16|No tel|Masan Agu-jjim Street (마산 오동동 아구찜거리)|51728|A02|A02|A0203|A02030600|

As hinted by its name's meaning "bare mountain," there are few trees near its summit. Locals also refer to it as Eoksaesan (silver grass) Mountain because of the waves of eulalia covering its sides. The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>

The mountain’s gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels.

Silver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November.

Mireukdo Island is connected to Tongyeong through an undersea tunnel, Chungmu Bridge and Tongyeong Bridge, making it even more accessible to visitors. At the center of the island is the towering Mireuksan Mountain. The panoramic Hallyeosudo Viewing Ropeway, which opened in 2008, takes visitors to the summit of Mireuksan Mountain. The top offers a commanding view of the forests and valleys below. On a clear day, visitors can even see the Japanese island of Tsushima. The mountain’s hiking trails are well-maintained and are suitable for short hikes. The most traveled trail is the one starting from Yonghwasa Temple. Hikers taking this trail pass through Gwaneumsa Temple and Mireukjae to reach the top. The trail leads to Miraesa Temple and a grass field on the way down before finally going back to Yonghwasa Temple.

According to Samgukyusa (historical records published in 1281), King Mu (30th king of Baekje, in power 600-641 AD) and his wife Queen Seonhwa were said to have seen a vision of Mireuksamjon (the three Sanskrit) emerging from a large pond. At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>

The two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to have originally had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67m in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (676-935 AD) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.|9|+82-63-859-3873, +82-63-830-0900|Mireuksa Temple Site [UNESCO World Heritage] (익산 미륵사지 [유네스코 세계문화유산])|54574|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

The site holds the graves of Saint Andreas Kim Daegeon, Korea’s first Catholic Saint; his mother Ursula; Bishop Ferréol, the third head of the Joseon parish who ordained Priest Kim; and Vincentius Lee Minsik who buried Saint Kim’s body. To be sure, this holy site is a serene and peaceful sanctum. 
<br><br>
The reason it came to be called ‘Mirinae’ is that Korean Catholics came to this place in secret to avoid persecution during the late Joseon dynasty, and the lamplight coming from their homes in the village where they settled resembled the starlight of the Milky Way. Father Kim was executed at the age of 26 and was not permitted a funeral. But, 40 days after the execution, Vincentius Lee Minsik was able to steal away Kim’s body with great difficulty; he carried it on his back eventually burying it in Mirinae – dismissing all advisement and council that urged him against this. At the center of the site stands a grand memorial church and the Way of the Cross behind it has 15 bronze sculptures depicting the passion of Jesus being captured by Roman soldiers, crucified, suffering, passing away, and being interred.
<br><br>
Kim Daegeon (1822~1846) <br>
Korea’s first Catholic priest and saint. He was chosen as a scholarship recipient by a French priest, and joined the priesthood at the young age of 24. Kim returned to Korea, but was captured, and executed, dying a martyr. He was blessed by the Roman Pope Pius XI on July 5, 1925, and became a Catholic saint at the canonization ceremony conducted by Pope John Paul II himself in South Korea on May 6, 1984.|16|+82-31-674-1256|Mirinae Holy Site (미리내 성지)|17500|A02|A02|A0201|A02010900|

At Misiryeonggyegok Valley the water is clean and many Giam cliffs can be found. Visitors can also find the rarely known Dojeokpokpo Falls and Chotdaebawi Rock. On the way to Inje from Dojeokpokpo Falls, you will come across Seonbawi Rock, where you can take a quick rest. Beyond that point, the valley is 2.5 km long ending at Yongdae-samgeori.  You must hold on to a rope while climbing down the steep pathway to Dojeokpokpo Falls. There is a myth saying that Dojeok, meaning thief in Korean, hid until he discovered a person passing through Misiryeong. When a person appeared, the thief would rob the person kill the traveler by drowning him/her in the waterfall. Therefore, the waterfall was named Dojeokpokpo or Dojeokso. Misiryeonggyegok Valley still preserves its beauty of primeval forest and has relatively low temperature during summer.

Known as the oldest surviving Western-style house in Gwangju, the house is an icon of modern culture and architecture in Korea. The house was built by an American missionary named Wilson in the 1920s (exact date unknown) and was the home of the Wilson family while they stayed in Korea. When the family completed their work in Korea, they sold the house for a very cheap price with the stipulation that the house continued to be used for missionary purposes. The house fell into the possession of the General Assembly of Chonnam Presbyterian Church of Korea in 1986 and now serves as the home office for the Presbyterian Church of Korea. <br><br>

The square-shaped house consists of a living room, a family room, a kitchen, and a bathroom (1F), several bedrooms (2F), and storage areas and a boiler room (B1). The fact that the entrance of the house faces east is said to be a result of the prevailing architectural culture of Korea at that time.

It stretches over 1.5 kilometers with a x_width of 30 meters; there are over 2,000 trees that create canopies with x_heights varying from 10 to 15 meters.

All in all, 10,000 trees create the feeling of being in an ancient forest, deep in the mountains.<br><br>

The forest was built by people in nearby villages 300 years ago in order to control winds and waves. From above, elegant curvilinear coastal lines are enveloped by lush trees of the forest, serving as a protection against the Namhae sea.

The valley is surrounded by Jeongsoksan Mountain to the northeast, Wonjeoksan Mountain to the south, and Cheonseongsan Mountain to the southeast. The water running through the numerous valleys between these mountains has formed streams like Yongyeoncheon and Sangricheon from Naewonsagyegok Valley which are the source of Yangsancheon Stream. <br><br>

Naewonsagyegok Valley was formerly Sogeumgang (little Geumgang), meaning that its beautiful scenery is comparable to that of the breathtaking Geumgangsan Mountain. It is also known as the “mystical valley” as crystal clear water flows all year round. The word “Sogeumgang” is distinctly engraved on one side of the cliff and large rocks stand in layers throughout the valley. Some of the rocks are called “byeongpung bawi,” literally meaning folding screen rocks, as they are stretched out much like folding screens. 
<br><br>
The valley and the surrounding mountains are a popular summer vacation spot and a well-known hiking destination during the spring, fall, and winter. Muk (acorn jelly) made with acorns gathered from this area not only tastes great, but is also very healthy. Nearby attractions include Tongdosa Temple, Hongnyongpokpo Falls, Tongdo Fantasia, Tongdo Finest Country Club, and Haewoon Youth Training Institute.

The legacy of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the park not only houses the country’s largest sports arena, but has also become a place where Seoul residents come to relax and unwind. 
<br><br>
Spread across approximately 1.45 million square meters, Olympic Park encompasses the land that was once Mongchontoseong Fortress and Mongchonhaeja (manmade lake) from the early Baekje period. The park is divided into several zones, including a leisure sports park, a cultural art park, an eco-park, and the History Experience Park dedicated to the area’s rich historic heritage. 
<br><br>
Because Olympic Park is so large and takes over three hours to explore, visitors are advised to familiarize themselves with entrances and exits and travel routes before they start. To further save time, visitors can ride the Road Train (“Hodori Train”) located next to Peace Square. 
<br><br>
* Cultural Art Park<br>
The Cultural Art Park is a place where visitors can enjoy diverse cultural experiences and performances. The park also features Olympic Museum, Seoul Olympics Museum of Art (SOMA)—one of the world’s top five sculpture museums—and Music Fountain. 
<br><br>
* Leisure Sports Park<br>
This area is comprised of Sports Square (walking/jogging paths, an acupressure path, inline skating area, etc.) and Peace Square (a pleasant area with a wide variety of activities and sports lessons). 
<br><br>
* Environmental Eco-Park<br>
Persistent efforts have succeeded in restoring natural splendor to this place where a equally splendid civilization once blossomed. People and nature co-exist comfortably within Environmental Eco-Park, which has become home to families of spot-billed ducks, white herons, cuckoos, pheasants, Korean squirrels, chipmunks, and frogs. More recent efforts to rejuvenate the local ecosystem have resulted in the appearance of woodpeckers and raccoons, both of which are rarely spotted in cities. The croaking of small round frogs can now be heard within the park as well. 
<br><br>
* History Experience Park 
Visitors to the park can experience Korean history firsthand at Mongchontoseong Fortress and Baekje Museum, while hearkening back to the more recent, grand spirit of the Olympics in the "Holy Land of Peace."|18|+82-2-2180-3564|Olympic Park (올림픽공원)|05540|A02|A02|A0202|A02020700|

Gongneung is the royal tomb of Queen Jangsun (1445-1461), consort of King Yejong, the 8th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. She died when she was still a crown princess, so her tomb is very simple. There is not even a “Mangjuseok,” which is the name for the pair of stones that stand on either side of the mound. <br><br>
Sulleung is the tomb of Queen Gonghye (1456-1474), a consort of King Seongjong, the 9th ruler of the Joseon dynasty. Sulleung is similar to Gongneung in many ways, but it has more stonework. Queen Gonghye was the 4th daughter of Han Myeong-Hoe, a high-ranking government officer, and a sister of Queen Jangsun, who is buried in Gongneung. This was the only time in the history of the Joseon dynasty that two sisters both became queen.<br><br>
Yeongneung is the tomb of the posthumously designated king, King Jinjong (1719-1728), the first son of King Yeongjo, and Queen Hyosun (1715-1751). King Jinjong became the crown prince at the age of 7, but he died when he was only 13 in Changgyeonggung Palace. Queen Hyosun became the crown princess when she was 13 years old.

Petite France serves as both a French cultural village and a youth training facility (Goseong Youth Training Center), and consists of 16 French-style buildings where visitors can lodge and experience French food, clothing, and household culture.
<br><br>
The concept of Petite France encapsulates ‘flowers, stars, and the Little Prince.’ The village contains a memorial hall dedicated to Saint-Exupery, the author of the celebrated French novel, Le Petit Prince (1943) and as such it is called the Little Prince theme park. It also has a gallery displaying sculptures and paintings of le coq gaulois (the Gallic rooster), the national symbol of France; Orgel House where a 200-year-old music box plays a sweet melody; a shop that sells herbal and aromatic products; a souvenir shop; and many other locales where you can experience French culture. The village can accommodate up to 200 visitors with 34 guest rooms that hold four to ten people each.

The tunnel is approximately 3 meters in x_height and 10 meters in length, and divides the villages of Sindu Maeul into Dugil-ri, Seolcheon-myeon and Inam Maeul in Socheon-ri. During the Three Kingdoms Period, the rocky ridges of Seokgyeonsan Mountain drew the boundary of Silla's Mupung in the east with Baekje's Seolcheo to the west. <br>
Tracing the history from the Three Kingdoms Period to the Goryeo dynasty, the cultures and traditions of the two regions were markedly different. If curious about the difference, one could simply stop by Seolcheon on market day, where the Muju and Mupung local 
dialects and customs can easily be distinguished. 
<br><br>
People used to cross Seokgyeonsan Mountain by a footpath along the rocky ridge to travel between Seolcheon and Mupung. During the Japanese occupation, a new road was created by turning a cave into a tunnel through the mountain so cows and horse carts could freely pass from Muju to Gimcheon. 
<br><br>
General Kim Yoo Shin from the Silla Kingdom, the hero of unification of the Three Kingdoms, often passed by the gate, later giving rise to the gate's nickname, Tongilmun (literally "Unification Gate"). The gate

The myth describes how unlike other mountains on Jejudo Island, this mountain does not have a crater. The 5m-high rock cave at the cliff on the southwest side of the mountain was originally called Sanbanggul Cave, but it is called a temple now because it possesses a Buddhist statue.
<br>
This is where monk Hye-Il (964~1053) had lived during the Goryeo dynasty (918~1392)

Inside the cave, you can see Marado Island and the Dragon Head Coast. You can also see small ponds being made by the water drops that fall from the ceiling all through the year.

The cliffs on the southern side of the lava dome are marked with a rich variety of curious formations such as weathering pits and talus scree slopes, some of which are as high as 200 meters. As its name ‘sanbang’ – literally meaning ‘a cave inside a mountain’ – suggests, this mountain contains a cave, which is located about 150 meters above sea level and has a spectacular view out over the ocean. Due to its close location to the sea and its high elevation, the peak is often ringed with clouds. The upper slopes of the mountain have their own distinct climatic conditions and are protected for their value for botanical research. <br>
<br>
The Sanbangsa Temple and  Bomunsa Temple, which holds the relics of Buddha, are both located on the mountain. Walk along the stone-steps between the two temples and you will find the Sanbanggulsa Grotto. A signal beacon called ‘Yeondae’ in Korean stands at the roadside in front of the mountain, which, in the past, used to fire and smoke to relay urgent messages. Regarding function, it is similar to the more well-known ‘Bongsudae’ signal beacons; but ‘Yeondae’ beacons were built around hilly or coastal areas while ‘Bongsudae’ beacons were built on mountain tops. During the daytime, smoke was used to send warning signals, while fire was used at night. <br>

Clear footprints of dinosaurs that lived during the Cretaceous Period of the Mesozoic Era remain extending over the coast around Sangjogam region, and thus the area was designated Goseong-gun Gosi No. 20. on November 10, 1983. The beach in front of the Youth Center contains shingles worn down by the tide and a precipitous wall of stratified rocks can be seen beyond the wide bedrock of dinosaur footprints. The rocks are named after the table leg-shaped stone caves such as “Ssangjok” or “Ssangbal”. Many oddly shaped rocks inside the caves have their own folktales. According to one tale, fairies from heaven came down to the Sangjokgul Cave to weave clothes out of brocade for the King of Heaven, and bathed in the Seonnyoetang Pond.

A painting of the caving titled "Golgulseokgul" by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face – sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo.

The temple had been taken care of by Hwang Hee’s descendants for generations, but at one time became ruined. The temple was rebuilt in modern days.<br><br>

The current buildings were re-constructed by Monk Beobin in 1985. Inside, there are Buddhist buildings like Daeungjeon, Gwaneumjeon, Samseonggak, and Beomjongnu.

Walking around the village at dusk, visitors will realize why the village is called Dalgogae (moon hill): 
the village was built on a flat plain and when the moon rises slowly, the place 
is illuminated&nbsp;by the&nbsp;moonlight.  While basking in the moonlight, people will hear the sound of a flock of wild ducks flying together. In this ordinary-looking  village, the long-standing tradition of Hansan mosi (ramie fabric) is 
passed down and preserved in the hands of the village women. 
<br><br>
Hansan mosi is also called 'semosi' (fine ramie) because of the time-consuming 
and labor-intensive process involved. The village offers a variety of mosi-themed 
experience programs for visitors. Village artisans  with valuable mosi-related 
experience assist the participants.  Programs include ramie plant harvesting and ramie fabric weaving. 
Visitors can also try some highly nutritious  ramie rice cakes and tea.
<br><br>
Mosi's history can be traced back as far as the period of the Three Kingdoms.  It is said 
that during&nbsp;the  Baekje Dynasty, an old man  found the ramie plant at the foot of Geonjisan Mountain after a mountain god appreared in his dream. The natural fabric, mosi, is so thin and delicate that it is compared to 
the wings of a dragonfly. In&nbsp;the  Goryeo Dynasty, the king presented the China's 
king with Hansan mosi. In the Joseon Dynasty, mosi was was offered to the kings.<br><br>
One can see the difference between mosi and regular fabric by trying on mosi 
clothes made by the artisans. Experience programs at the village also include natural dyeing, making mosi jegi (object used to play jegichagi) and mosi mobile phone accessories. Food made from mosi plants include mosi buchimgae (Korean pancake) and mosi bread.
<br><br>
Another fun activity at the village is <i>hangwa</i> (traditional sweets & cookies) making. Hangwa-making, 
much like producing mosi, is a labor-intensive process. In making hangwa, grains harvested at the village 
are used. The grains are fried for a short time, carefully mixed with honey, and then 
flattened. After it cools down and hardens, it is then cut into small pieces. The taste of freshly-made hangwa adds to the joy 
of the experience, making it the best activity of the program.|8|+82-41-950-6380|Seocheon Dalgogae Mosi (Ramie Fabric) Village (서천 달고개모시마을)|33630|A02|A02|A0203|A02030100|

There are two, three-storied stone pagodas in the heart of Namsan Village and a small, elegant pond to the east. The pond is famous thanks to a Korean legend, written below:
<br><br>
In the 10th year of King Soji (488) of Silla, a crow and a mouse approached the king as he was on his way to Namsan Mountain. The mouse told the King to “follow after the crow” for an easy journey. So, the King and his servant (who was traveling with him) followed the crow, but became distracted and lost their way. As they were wandering about a pond (now known as Seochulji), an old man appeared from the waters’ depths and presented an envelope to the King. Based on the message in the envelope, the King instructed his servant to fire an arrow at the Geomungo (Korean musical instrument) case nearby. The shot killed the queen and a monk who had been hiding there, both of whom had been hatching a plot against the King. 
<br><br>
The name of the pond, “Seochulji” (literally meaning “writing from the pond”) originates from this legend. It is said that a man named Imjeok built a building by the pond in the 5th year of King Hyeonjong (1664) to enjoy the scenery. The simple, yet elegant building still remains at the northwest of the pond.|2|+82-54-779-6079|Seochulji Pond in Gyeongju (Lotus Flower) (경주 서출지)|38174|A01|A01|A0101|A01010500|

Seonjeongneung is comprised of Seolleung Royal Tomb and Jeongneung Royal Tomb. Located in downtown Seoul, this place offers tranquil and pleasant promenades for couples and office workers. Seonjeongneung houses the burial mounds of King Seongjong (1469-1494), his wife Queen Jeonghyeon, and King Jungjong (1506-1544) of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910).
<br><br>
Upon entering the grounds, you can see a red gate (the red colour denotes holiness) with a taegeuk (yin-yang) symbol. The stone paths leading to the sacrificial building are noteworthy because there are two stone paths—the elevated path is for the dead King and the lower one is for living people. <br><bR>In the past, memorial rites were performed in the sacrificial building. Small sculptures on the eaves called Japsang were carved in the shape of animals, such as monkeys, and were believed to exorcise evil spirits. Next to the sacrificial building, there is a pavilion and a tombstone for the tomb of the king. Sculptures of sheep and tigers surround the tomb and are guardians of the deceased king. There is also a statue of a military officer bearing a sword. In front of the tomb is an outstanding sight called 'Mangjuseok,' which is a pair of stones designed to guide the spirit of the king to his tomb. Unlike the tombs of the kings, the queen’s tomb, Wanghureung, is simple. It doesn’t have any pavilions or sacrificial buildings, and is surrounded only by stone sculptures as guardians.  
<br><br>
Seonjeongneung has a lush forest, and benches on the promenade provide an ideal place to relax.

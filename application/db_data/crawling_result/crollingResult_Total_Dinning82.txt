Its thick dough makes it chewy and delightful. For one person, “Manduguk”(boiled dumpling soup) is a good choice. The delicious and nourishing taste of Mandu goes well with the sweet, spicy, and fresh taste of the soup. Manduguk is served in a brass bowl which keeps the food warm while eating. For a large-size group, “Mandujeongol” cooked with various vegetables in a casserole is recommended. There are two types of Mandujeongol that have different tastes. The main characteristic of “Kimchi Mandujeongol” is its spicy flavor, which reminds people of the refreshing taste of Kimchi soup, and “Tojang Mandujeongol” expounds on the savory taste of bean-paste soup. Tojang means folk soybean-paste. 
“Nokdujeon”(a Korean pan-fried dish with green mung bean) is another famous dish at Darakjeong, which is pan-fried with a very light seasoning to emphasize the original taste of Nokdu (green mung bean). Salted oysters with hot pepper are served with Nokdujeon instead of soy sauce, which is a perfect match.|23|+82-2-725-1697|Darakjeong (다락정)|03049|A05|A05|A0502|A05020100|

Dombedon restaurant, introduced in a MBC program, only uses meat from black pigs raised on Jeju Island. The meat is not only tasty, but is also low in fat, high in nutrition, and is said to be beneficial for health and beauty purposes—making it especially popular among women.

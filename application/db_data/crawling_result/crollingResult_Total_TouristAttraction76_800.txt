<br>
The streets of Cheongho-dong are lined with small Korean houses reminding many of Seoul in the 1970s. The simple nature of the town and quietness of the sea make for a unique atmosphere in Cheongho-dong.  This area became extremely popular after the Korean drama "Autumn in My Heart" was filmed here. In the drama, the lead actress’s mother had a supermarket in Cheongho-dong.  Nearby the supermarket the lead actress often took a boat, which has now become a popular attraction for tourists. Holding up to 35 people, this ‘Gaetbae’ boat operates on manpower (people pulling on ropes moving the boat across a waterway) and can be taken from downtown Sokcho to Cheongho-dong.

During the Joseon Dynasty, the current day Bonghwa and Yongmabong Peak and the Manguri Cemetery were considered part of Achasan Mountain. Twenty bastions were discovered along Achasan Mountain that were originally estimated to date back to the Three Kingdoms Era.

In light of these findings, it was officially designated a Historic Site No. 455 (2004).|6|No tel|Achasan Mountain (아차산)|04965|A01|A01|A0101|A01010400|

The mountain is where North and South Korea engaged in a fierce battle at the end of the Korean War; after the battle, Korea was divided into two nations. Since the peak is still a restricted area, visitors must present their passport in order to be admitted. From the peak, an open view of North Korean territory unfolds below and visitors can see South Korean territory as far as Songhaksan Mt. in Chungcheongnamdo Province. 
<br><br>
Even before the Korean War, Aegibong carried much historical significance as the setting of the sad love story between the governor of Pyeongyang and his mistress. The two lovers were separated during the Sino-Korean War in 1636 and the peak (‘Ae, 애’ means love, ‘gi, 기’ mistress in Korean) was named in honor of their love. 
<br><br>
In 1968, president Park Cheong Hee visited the peak and wrote a note by hand, saying the mistress' pain of being separated from her lover because of the war was much like those of families separated by the division of the two Koreas. The president’s writing was carved in a tablet and placed at the peak, where separated families still come every thanksgiving to perform an ancestral ritual and wish for reunification. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
At the foot of the mountain, Han River empties into the ocean along the west coast, which is expressed by the term 'Jogang (조강)‘ (‘grandfather river’ in Korean). The scenery of the river with its boats, surrounding islands, and converging estuaries creates a unique and cozy scene that seems to be in harmony with the image of a kindly grandfather.

<br><br>
The tumuli relics were excavated by researchers from the Kyungsung University Museum from 1990 to 1992 and were found to be the common burial ground of the dominant class of the Gaya Kingdom. On the hilltops, which were viewed as prime burial places, are the tombs of kings and rulers; on the slopes are the tombs of the lower classes. 
<br><br>
A total of 136 tumuli were found in the Daesong-dong area. Further investigation of the tumuli revealed several important and interesting facts. First, from the end of the third century, men and horses were buried alive along with the dead. Also, weapons were bent and buried as well, with many of these artifacts being unearthed among the tumuli. Other materials found in the tumuli such as cylindrical bronze items, pinwheel-shaped bronze items, and jasper items showed that Gaya was involved in trade with Japan.

After her death, she becomes a ghost and appears to every district magistrate (highest-ranking officer in a region) to appeal for the investigation of her unfair death, but each district magistrate dies of a heart attack. <br><br>
Then, a new district magistrate by the name Lee is dispatched to the area. Unlike his predecessors, Lee listens to the story of the ghost and finds the low-ranked officer who had killed her and punishes him. He found Arang’s body and holded a religious ceremony on her behalf. Aranggak was also built in her memory. <br><br>

Every year, an event called Arangje is held on April 16 by the lunar calendar in Aranggak Pavilion. Young maidens dressed in white hanbok perform a religious ceremony to soothe the sorrow of Arang.

It is here that Jeongseon Arirang, the No. 1 Intangible Cultural Asset of Gangwon-do, originated. The area has long been famous for its beautiful, clean mountains and rivers. Its name is derived from the Korean word <em>eoureojida,</em> meaning "to meet" as the waters of Pyeongchang and Samcheok unite in this area.<br>
<br>Part of the upper stream of Namhangang River, Auraji was a famous starting point of log rafts transporting timber to Hanyang, the original name of Seoul. In the old days, one could always hear the singing of boatmen who came from all over the nation. The lyrics of Jeongseon Arirang reveal the sadness and longing of a woman awaiting her husband who left for business to a far-away place or left to transport timber. Today, numerous tourists visit Auraji to enjoy its great scenic views or to see the symbol of a maid who, gazing into the river, seems to be waiting for her lover to return.|11|+82-1544-9053|Auraji Lake (아우라지)|26106|A01|A01|A0101|A01011700|

However, major renovations took place ahead of the first Busan International Film Festival (BIFF), and the newly transformed district was named BIFF Square on August 14, 1996.<br>
<br>
 Having been remade into a&nbsp;cultural tourist attraction promoting the advancement of Korea’s film industry, BIFF Square has contributed to Busan’s newfound status as an international cultural tourist city. The 428 meter-long street stretching from the Buyeong Theater in Nampo-dong to the overpass in Chungmu-dong was divided into “Star Street” and “Festival Street,” and on the eve of the festival each year the “BIFF Square Ground Opening” is held on the street. During the ceremony, events such as the hand printing of famous movie celebrities and Nunggot Jeomdeung (snow-flower lighting) take place. A district such as BIFF Square, crowded with first-run theaters in a city is rare not only in Asia but Europe as well, and for this reason it holds great potential. In recent years, the square has grown into a more complex area, featuring not only movie theaters but also shops and leisure facilities, attracting growing numbers of young visitors and tourists.|15|+82-51-253-8523|BIFF Square (BIFF 광장 (구, PIFF 광장))|48953|A02|A02|A0203|A02030600|

As such, the island is not accessible on foot, but can be viewed from a sightseeing cruise ship. Along with Geomundo and several other islands in the region, Baekdo Island is part of the Dadohae Maritime National Park.<br><br>
<b>Island History</b><br>
Most of Baekdo's legend and history has been dervied by the settlers of Geomundo Island. As Baekdo's islets can be seen from Geomundo, they have always played a part in the daily lives of the people from Geomundo. Rituals are held on Geomundo every August to worship the god that is believed to live on Baekdo, and thought to prevent people with impure minds from visiting by creating dense fog.<br>
The number of islets that make up Baekdo remains disputable. The island group was said to be composed of 100 islets, hence Baekdo ("baek" meaning "hundred", and "do" meanining "island"). However, modern day counts vary, from anywhere between 24 and 67, according to the actions of the tides. The official number of islets is 39.<br>
Baekdo Island is divided in to two island groups: Sangbaekdo to the north, and Habaekdo to the south. During the Japanese occupation of the area, the names of island groups were reversed; Habaekdo, located closer to Japan, had been referred to as the northern group. The names were changed back to its original state during the 1990's.|13|+82-61-690-2607|Baekdo Island (여수 백도)|556-851|A01|A01|A0101|A01011300|

Since then, these rock engraving have been a representative cultural asset of Ulsan and have been a key reference point in research on rock carving techniques. The Bangudae Petroglyphs were designated National Treasure No. 285 in 1996.<br>
Petroglyphs (岩刻畵) are figures of animals or geometrical symbols engraved on rock. The Bangudae Petroglyphs are engraved on rocks located on the lower western banks of the man-made lake at Taehwa River. Due to the increased water levels resulting from the construction of the dams, the petroglyphs (10m wide and 3m tall) can only be seen during the dry season from October to February. Since the Daegok River blocks a closer view of the engraved figures, a model measuring 6m in x_width and 3m in x_height has been set up across from the Bangudae Petroglyphs to give visitors a better understanding of this unique ancient art.<br><br>
 
The engravings depict a total of 200 etchings including figures of land animals (deer, tigers, wild boars, etc.), hunting scenes, sea animals (whales, seals, sea turtles), and boats and fishermen. The Bangudae Petroglyphs are important reflections of the hunting rituals and religious arts of Korea’s prehistoric era and serve as an important clue into the lifestyle and customs of ancient Koreans.<br><br>|5|+82-52-229-0101, +82-52-229-6678|Bangudae Petroglyphs (울주 대곡리 반구대 암각화)|44913|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

This area then is being developed as a tourist destination as the originating place of Buddhism in Korea.  Note: the word ‘Beop’ in ‘Beop-seong-po’ means Buddhism while ‘Seong’ means a saint, referring to the Indian Monk Marananta. 
<br><br>
The origins of Buddhism in Korea are clear for Goguryeo and the Silla Kingdoms, but regarding the Kingdom of Baekje it is a little more obscure. It has been claimed by word of mouth in this region that the Indian Monk Marananta came to Beopseongpo of Yeonggwang to deliver his message of Buddhism and built the Bulgapsa Temple (불갑사) which hence became the first monument of Buddhism in the Baekje Kingdom.|16|+82-61-350-5752|Birthplace of Baekje Buddhism (백제불교최초도래지)|57009|A02|A02|A0201|A02010900|

She would grow up to be the wife of the dynasty’s 26th ruler, King Gojong. The birthplace and the adjoining Memorial Hall are open to the public. 
<br>

Empress Myeongseong was a brilliant diplomat who pursued openness and reform to maintain the sovereignty of the nation. Unfortunately, her tumultuous life came to an end in the early morning hours of October 8, 1895 when she was murdered by the Japanese army. 
<br>

<br>
During Japanese colonial rule, the empress was wrongfully accused of being a jealous and overly ambitious person. Studies of various archives have since revealed what a great person she really was. Recently, numerous television productions and musicals have also corrected those misunderstandings. Renovated in 1995, her birthplace includes three buildings with servants’ quarters, master’s quarters, and a separate house. A commemorative monument now stands at the site of the room where the empress studied as a child. The Memorial Hall in front of the house contains various archives and artifacts related to Empress Myeongseong’s life.

However, it has been rebuilt into an ‘L’-shaped hanok (traditional Korean house) with two large trees growing in the front yard. Lee was born on February 23, 1907, one of five children to parents Lee Si-hoo and Kang Hong-kyung. Lee Hyo-seok’s wife, Lee Kyung-won was an aspiring artist.

The fortress was built with a wall spanning about 8,500 meters, built specifically to stop foreign invasion. It is one of the representative mountain fortresses of the Joseon Era. In the fall, the view you can get from the fortress of the mountain is spectacular. Temples are also representative of rich culture that flourished on Bukhansan. The Seungasa Temple on the east Bibong Peak, with <i>Maaeseokgayeoraejwasang</i> 
 (seated rock-carved Buddhas) carved into a 5 meter granite rock, and the Munsusa Temple located halfway up the Musubong Peak, with purified mountain water dropping from the ceiling of Munsugol Cave, are indicative of both Bukhansan's history and culture. <br><br>With its granite peaks and Bukhansanseong Fortress, Bukhansan is perfect for hiking in all seasons. In the spring, all kinds of flowers bloom, and in the summer, lush forests carpet the numerous valleys. The hiking path along the valley is perhaps the best summer mountain climbing course. 
And the fall is the perfect time to visit the temples and pavilions in their autumn colors. In the winter, the snow-covered mountain scenery is very beautiful. 
The park averages 5 million visitors and has received the Honor of being in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the national park with the highest number of visitors per square foot.|3|+82-2-954-2566|Bukhansan National Park (Dobong Section) (북한산국립공원(도봉 지구))|01300|A01|A01|A0101|A01010100|

It serves as an industrial road that facilitates the transport of freight and cargo from Yeondong-gu District, the center of the shipbuilding industry and an emerging port.
<br><br>
Busandaegyo Bridge is 260 meters long and 20 meters wide, with 16 meters for cars and 2 meters of sidewalk on each side.  Boats of up to 14 meters in x_height can pass beneath the bridge, so ships can easily travel between the ports to the north and south. Situated parallel to Busandaegyo Bridge is Yeongdodaegyo Bridge, and the distance between these two bridges is about 100 meters.
<br><br>
Both ends of the bridge are connected to an elevated road that is 30 meters long and 16-20 meters wide. The bridge also leads to the expressway, which then connects to Gyeongbu Expressway.
<br><br>
Compared to other bridges built around the same time, Busandaegyo Bridge has a greater significance in the hearts of the citizens as it was built to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Busan Port and symbolizes the development of the city.|14|+82-51-600-4000|Busandaegyo Bridge (부산대교)|49045|A02|A02|A0205|A02050100|

The temple, which is also known as Seosan Buseoksa, is not as well known as Yeongju Buseoksa Temple in Gyeongsangbuk-do Province because of its size and lack of extensive historical documentation. The temple was built by the Great Monk Uisang in 677, the 17th year of King Munmu of Silla, and was later rebuilt by Great Monk Muhak during the Joseon dynasty. <Br><Br>
The beautiful <i>Geumdonggwaneumbosaljwasang</i>, or seated gilt-bronze Buddha statue, which was housed in the Buseoksa Temple in 1330, is now located in a temple on Tsushima Island in Japan. The only remaining buildings of Buseoksa are the large Geungnakjeon Hall, Mongnyongjang (the monks' living quarters), Simgeomdang, and Anyangnu. Walking up from the main hall, visitors will find the Sansingak building, and a stone pagoda close to the entrance of the Dobisan Mountain hiking trail. From the summit of Dobisan Mountain, one can get an amazing view of the Seohae Sea beyond Ganwoldo and Anmyeondo islands, as well as Gayasan Mountain.

The temple was founded by Great Monk Uisang (625-702) upon orders from the king. When Uisang was studying in the Dang Dynasty of China, he heard of a plot by the Dang Dynasty to attack Silla. Upon hearing this, he hurried home and passed the message along to the king. The temple was created to pray for protection of the country.<br><br>

Buseoksa Temple gets its name from a large stone to the west of Buljeon Hall, that appears to be floating rather than supported by the stone beneath it. During the Goryeo Dynasty, the temple was referred to Seondalsa Temple or Heunggyosa Temple. During excavation work in 1916, artifacts were discovered recording history of repair work. According to these findings, it was learned that Muryangsujeon Hall and other buildings were rebuilt in the early part of the Goryeo Dynasty. The hall burned down during war in 1358, and was later rebuilt in 1376. Josadang Shrine was rebuilt in 1377.<br><br> 

Buseoksa Temple is home to many national treasures, including Stone Lantern at Muryangsujeon Hall of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 17), Muryangsujeon Hall of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 18), Josadang Shrine of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 19), Clay Seated Buddha of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 45), Mural Painting in Josadang Shrine of Buseoksa Temple (National Treasure No. 46), Stone Seated Buddhas in Bukji-ri (Treasure No. 220), Three-story Stone Pagoda of Buseoksa Temple (Treasure No. 249), Flagpole Supports of Buseoksa Temple (Treasure No. 255), Printing Woodblocks of Buddhist Scriptures in Buseoksa Temple (Treasure 735), and more.

Seongheungsan has a wide view of the plain by the Geumgang River and the neighboring mountains.

It has a x_height of about 8.4 kilometers. The wall surrouned Busosanseong Fortress and extended to the city of Buyeo. <br><br>
The wall is one of the oldest walls along with Naseong in Pyeongyang and it is estimated to have been built around 538, when the Baekje capital was changed from Woonjin (current Gongju) to Sabi (current Buyeo). The wall of the fortress starts from the site where Dongmun (East gate) was located to the area of Geumgang River, made by piling soil up. However, only a few traces remain of its former glory. <br><br>
For now, it leaves a blurry trail including a 20 meter area to the east of Cheongsanseong Fortress, Dongmun Bridge from Seokmok-ri, and an area from Pilseobong Peak to Yeomchang-ri. While the outer wall is sharply sloped, the inner wall was built with a gentle slope to make it easier for horses to reach the guard posts on the top of the wall. Inside the fortress, the palace of Baekje, government offices, houses, temples, stores and protected facilities can be seen. The entire structure of Naseong Fortress features Geumgang River in the south and west sides, providing a natural double-defense system. The wall was one of the important outer defense facilities along with Cheongsanseong and Cheongmasanseong Fortresses.

It was moved to its current location in Byeongsan by a well-respected Cofucian scholar named Yu Seong-nyong, penname Seoae, in 1572.<br><br>

When Yu Seong-nyong passed away in 1607, many of his followers and other renowned scholars commemorated the late scholar by building Jondeoksa Shrine to enshrine his ancestral tablet in 1613, followed by renaming of the institution to Byeongsanseowon in 1614. Yu Seong-nyong's ancestral tablet was later moved to Yeogangseowon to be placed together with the ancestral tablet of Toegye Yi Hwang. In 1629, another ancestral tablet of the late scholar was made and housed in Jondeoksa Shrine. <br><br>

In 1863, Byeongsanseowon was recognized by the king to receive support as a private Confucian academy. The lecture hall and shrine were reconstructed in 1921 and 1937 respectively as part of preservation efforts made during the Japanese occupation.

The story of Dangun reads that he made sacrifices over 4,000 years ago, making this relic a historical treasure. 
<br>
Chamseongdan was renovated in 1270 under Goryeo Wonjong’s and after being renovated several more times. To this day it has remained the same way and kept the same appearance. Chamseongdan is a natural stone 5 meters in x_height, circular in shape at the bottom and rectangular at the top. Because it is in the middle of Baekdusan Mountain and Hallasan Mountain, you can see the islands of the West sea and the inland scenery. It is symbolically a very important place. It is said that in the past, the kings of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla Kingdoms all offered sacrifices to the heavens here.  This form of ceremonial sacrificing continued prevailed until the Joseon Period (1392~1910). Visitors can see from scattered relics how Korea’s ancestors revered and feared the heavens.  Even now, on Gaecheonjeol Day, Koreans offer sacrifices to Dangun here, and for national athletic events, a sacred flame for the games is ignited here. 
<br>
Manisan Mountain is 495m above sea level, which makes it the highest mountain in Ganghwa. The entire area was designated as a National Tour Site in 1977.

It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion. <br>
<br>
 The palace gained importance starting from the time of Seongjong, the 9th king of Joseon, when a number of kings began using it as a place of residence. Unfortunately, the palace was burned down by angry citizens in 1592 when the royal family fled their abode during the Japanese invasion of Korea. Thanks to Gwanghaegun, the palace was restored in 1611. Even today, it houses a number of cultural treasures, such as Injeongjeon Hall, Daejojeon Hall, Seonjeongjeon Hall, and Nakseonjae. <br>
<br>
 Changdeokgung Palace’s rear garden was constructed during the reign of King Taejong and served as a resting place for the royal family members. The garden had formerly been called Bukwon and Geumwon, but was renamed Biwon after King Kojong came into power. The garden was kept as natural as possible and was touched by human hands only when absolutely necessary. Buyongjeong, Buyongji, Juhabru, Eosumun, Yeonghwadang, Bullomun, Aeryeonjeong, and Yeongyeongdang are some of the many pavilions and fountains that occupy the garden. The most beautiful time to see the garden is during the fall when the autumn foliage is at its peak and the leaves have just started to fall. <br>
<br>
 Though it has been treasured by Koreans for centuries, Changdeokgung Palace was  recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee in December of 1997 during the committee meeting in Naples, Italy. <br>
<br>
Changdeokgung Palace was one of the places visited by the first ladies of the Seoul G20 summit during the G20 conference in Seoul in November 2010.

It often served as residential quarters for queens and concubines. During the reign of King Seongjong (r.1469-1494), the palace was renovated and renamed to Changgyeonggung Palace. It later became a park with a zoo and a botanical garden during Japanese colonial rule. The palace grounds remained this way until 1983 when restoration of its old grace was completed.
<br>
<br>Past the main entrance of Changgyeonggung Palace, Honghwa Gate, you will find Okcheongyo Bridge.  All palaces of the Joseon dynasty have ponds with an arch bridge over them, just like Okcheongyo Bridge.  Cross Okcheongyo Bridge, pass the Myeongjeongmun Gate, and you will find Myeonjeongjeon.  This is the office of the king, and Myeongjeongjeon is the oldest of the Joseon dynasty palaces.  The houses face southwards, but Myeongjeongjeon faces east. Because the ancestral shrine of the royal family is located to the south, the gate couldn't face the south, as is required by Confucian custom. There are stones with the status of the officials carved on the yard.  Behind Myeongjeongjeon on the upper left side  is Sungmundang.  This building utilizes the slope of the mountain.  If you look at Myeongjeongjeon and Munjeongjeon, the combination of the high and low roofs offers a beautiful view.
<br>
<br>Tongmyeongjeon was built for the queen.  It is the biggest building in Changgyeonggung Palace, and you can recognize the delicate details of its structure in various parts of the building.  Walk up the stones past Tongmyeongjeon and there you will find Jagyeongjeon.  On the southeast direction of the Jagyeongjeon is the Punggidae.  This Punggidae is a measuring instrument.  It is a long pole with a cloth hung at the end used to check the speed and direction of the wind.  If you head north there is a large pond called Chundangji.  Half of the pond was originally a rice field that the king took care of.  But during the Japanese occupation, the rice field was changed to a pond with little ships floating on it.  And the botanic garden built above the pond still remains today.|23|+82-2-762-4868|Changgyeonggung Palace (창경궁)|03072|A02|A02|A0201|A02010100|

When the gate was first built in 1396 (the 5th year of King Taejo's reign) during the establishment of the city, it was initially called Honghwamun. Unfortunately, the name happened to be the same as the east gate of Changgyeonggung Palace built in 1483 (during the 4th year of King Seongjong’s reign) so it was subsequently changed to Hyehwamun Gate in 1511 (during the sixth year of King Jungjong’s reign) to avoid confusion. The gate is also known as Dongsomun Gate (East Small Gate).
<br><br>
Hyehwamun Gate was an important gate for people moving toward the north of the country, since the gate to the north, Sukjeongmun Gate, was often closed. Hyehwamun Gate was destroyed when a street car line was built between Hyehwa-dong and Donam-dong during the Japanese Colonial Period, but was restored in 1992 and placed on a hill next to the road.

They are the largest natural swamps in South Korea, with a total size of about 5,550 square km. The bottom of the swamp is shallower than 1 meter and there are over 1,000 species living in its murky waters.  It has a primitive atmosphere with 100 kinds of plants containing 28 kinds of aquatic plants and 72 types of hydrophytes. <br>
<br>
 Upo Wetland is a primitive low bed wetland, which was created about 140 million years ago. When soft ground collapsed, water started to come to a low basin, a lake where dinosaurs lived 100 million years ago.  Upo Wetland was formed in with the sediments from the mountains brought in by rivers. From the outer edge, the current Upo Wetland is going through a natural alteration and ecological succession from a lake to swamp and from grass-covered plain to a forest. At Upo Wetland there are eight famous locations to see fireflies, constellation gazing, and willow groves, but there are&nbsp;many other interesting things to see. The Upo rain-fog is an especially eye-catching natural phenomenon, becoming visible when there is no wind, when skies are clear, and the temperature difference between daytime and nighttime is 10 degrees or more. The fireflies come out around&nbsp;20:00-21:00 in August and September. In winter, migrating birds spend their winter here and you can watch about 33 species of birds such as swans, whopper swans, bean geese, teals and wild ducks.

 Constructed during the reign of Queen Seon-deok (r. 632-647), it was used to observe stars in order to forecast the weather.  This stone structure is a beautiful combination of straight lines and curves, and was designated as National Treasure No.31 on December 20th, 1962. <br>
 <br>
 Cheomseongdae was built in a cylinder shape with stones 30cm in diameter.  362 stones were piled up to make 27 levels.  Roughly 4.16m up from the bottom there is a 1㎡ square entrance and a space to hang a ladder under it. <br>
 The inside is filled with soil up to the 12th level, and the 19th, 20th, 25th, and 26th levels all have long rocks hanging on two areas, shaped as the Chinese letter '井' (jeong). <br>
 <br>
 It stands 9.17m high and the base stone on each side measures 5.35m. <br> The Vernal Equinox, Autumnal Equinox, Winter Solstice, Summer Solstice and the 24 solar terms (also known as the astronomical solar year) were determined by observating of stars. The pavilion stone is believed to have been used as a standard of deciding directions, north, south, east and west.  The 362 stones used to build Cheomseongdae represented the 362 days in a lunar year.|2|+82-54-771-1336|Cheomseongdae Observatory (경주 첨성대)|38170|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

At Cheongnyangsan Mountain, the Giam cliff forms 12 peaks and the Nakdonggang River flows through it. On this mountain stands the Cheongnyangsa Temple, which was built by Buddhist monk, Won-hyo (617 ~ 686.3.30) during King Munmu’s (reign 661~681) third year of reign during the Silla Period (BC57~AD935). There are also various temples, Gwanchang Falls, and many other attractions nearby.

Behind the Provincial Park’s boulder is a monument with a poem inscribed on it by the famous scholar Toegye I Hwang (1501~1570) of the Joseon Period called Cheongnyangsanga.  When Toegye was planning to build Dosanseodang, a school for the teachings of Confucianism, he had a tough time deciding on whether to build it there at Cheongnyangsan Mountain, or the alternate spot, where it was eventually built, on a decision made at the last minute.
<br><Br>
Aside from Toegye I Hwang, Won-Hyo and Ui-Sang (625 ~ 702), the Buddhist monks, Gim-Saeng (711 ~ 791), a master of calligraphy, Chi-won Choi (857 ~ ?), a scholar, and many others came to this mountain to cultivate their arts. Their presence still lingers in legends, being retold to this day.

Osandang is believed to have been built by the disciples of Toegye at the spot where Toegye conferred with literary men, and is one of many relics found here, among them the Cheongnyangsan Mountain Castle, which is believed to have been built by King Gongmin (reign 1351~1374) of Goryeo Period, to escape the rebellions of the peasantry.|8|+82-54-679-6651|Cheongnyangsan Provincial Park (청량산도립공원)|36257|A01|A01|A0101|A01010200|

There is also a cliff named Wonja Rock right below the ice valley, which provides a retreat from the heat and gives visitors a beautiful view of the 62 meter-high artifical waterfall. During the wintertime, the waterfall is frozen and many people come to climb the ice wall or participate in the annual Ice Wall Climbing Competition. Even if you're not into sports, the shining wall of frozen water makes for a beautiful site and is a wintertime favorite among the nation's photographers.|21|+82-54-870-6111|Cheongsong Eoreumgol Valley-Cheongsong UNESCO Global Geopark (청송 얼음골 -청송 국가지질공원)|37441|A01|A01|A0101|A01010900|

It is a historic islet related to the famous folktale of Cheoyong. The tale is about a dragon that emerged from the east sea along with his seven sons at the end of the Silla Kingdom (57BC - 935AD). One of the dragon’s sons named Cheoyong came to the capital and married a beautiful woman. One night, he found an evil spirit trying to attack his wife so he sang and danced, whereupon the spirit presented itself and kneeled in apology. Since then, people have used the image of Cheoyong to dispel evil spirits.

known as Kim Jeong-Hui). This old house is known to have been constructed by the great-grandfather of Chusa, Kim Han-Sin.<br><br>

The Korean-style house compound (266.11m²) consists of Munganchae (a guesthouse), Soteuldaemun (a high gate), Sarangchae (ㄱ-shaped men's quarters), Anchae (ㅁ-shaped women’s quarters) and a shrine where the remains of Chusa are enshrined. Theㄱ-shaped Sarangchae stretches for one Kan* to the south and 2 Kans to the east and is comprised of two rooms and a Daecheongmaru (living area). The Anchae consists of a six-Kan Daecheongmaru (living area) and two one-Kan rooms.<br><br>

Located on the ground is a tomb where Chusa’s great-grandfather (Kim Han-Sin) and his wife (Hwasun Princess) are buried. Nearby you’ll see a gate that was constructed to commemorate Princess Hwasun’s faithfulness to her husband.<br><br>

If you walk about 600 meters to the north of the old house, you can see a lacebark pine tree, which was designated Natural Monument No. 106. The lacebark pine tree, originally from northern China, is among the few of its kind in Korea. It is said that Chusa snuck the pine across the border from China (formerly, the Qing Dynasty) into the country when he was 25 years old and planted it at the tomb of his great-grandfather. Originally, the tree had three branches, but two were broken and the third branch was damaged. In 1980, the damaged branch was treated and since then, the tree has been kept under strong protection.

<b>Island History<br></b>
Daecheongdo Island was said to be first inhabited during the Neolithic Age (9500-4500 BC), but the earliest known history periods begin during the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392 AD), when  the island was used as a place of exile. The first known case of an exile was recorded sometime during the reign of Chinese Emperor Togon-temur (1320-d.1370) from the Mongol Yuan dynasty. It was said that he was exiled on Daecheongdo for meddling in a plot arranged by his stepmother. He supposedly arrived on the island with 100 relatives, and built a palace here. The next known record relates to the island's abundance in medicinal herbs including mulberry mistletoe (Loranthi Ramulus), which was used to cure the illness of Queen Munjeong (d.1565), the wife of King Jungjong (d.1544). There is no record of island inhabitation until 1793, when King Jeongjo, the 22nd king of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1897), authorized the inhabitation and cultivation of the island. During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), there were as many as 10,000 people living on the island due to its popularity as a major port. Today, there are about 1,500 people who sustain a living from tourism and fisheries.|9|+82-32-899-3610|Daecheongdo Island (대청도)|23105|A01|A01|A0101|A01011300|

(1853-1922), who came to Daegu for missionary work. In 1899, the church building was constructed with wood using a Korean-style design, but was destroyed by fire a few months after construction began. Priest Robert created a new building design and imported stained glass and galvanized iron from France and Hong Kong, since these types of building materials were hard to find in Korea. Construction was finally completed in 1902, three years after the project was first started.

The Catholic Church is the only remaining structure in Daegu from the early 1900s. The church is Latin cross-shaped with a nave and transepts on both sides. Such formations are seen both inside and outside the building. This predominantly Romanesque church also features some Gothic architectural elements such as stained-glass windows and pinnacles. 
<br><br>
Daegu Gyesan Catholic Church played a pivotal role in promoting Catholicism in the Yeongnam area. In 1911, it was separated from the Joseon Catholic parish and became the main Catholic parish in Daegu area, naming Priest Robert as the first chief priest.

The temple, which was founded during the&nbsp;5th year of the Baekje Kingdom, has an interesting legend behind its origin. <br><br>According to the legend, an old monk fell asleep after praying under a large rock on the slopes of Seongheungsan Mountain. In his dream, a large bird glowing in gold  flew in from the west and sat on the rock where Daejosa currently stands. While the bird continuoulsy flapped its wings, a ray of light shone on the rock and it was there that the statue of Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared. 
<br><br>The old monk had the same dream at the same time for many days. He recounted his dream to the seongju (castle lord), who then reported it to King Seong of Baekje. The king interpreted the dream as a sign that it was the right time to move the capital of Baekje to Sabi (now Buyeo) and ordered the construction of a large temple at the location that appeared in the dream. The temple was so big that even at a hurried pace, it would still take 10 years to build. Workers had to work day and night, and every time the workers felt tired, birds would come singing to brighten up the atmosphere so that the workers can forget the fatigue and continue working. Hence, the temple was completed after only&nbsp;five years. Because of the golden bird, the temple was named Daejosa, literally meaning "temple of a great bird."<br><br> 
The rock on which Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared in the dream was recreated as a stone statue of a Buddha. This standing stone Maitreya Bodhisattva statue is a fine work of sculpture which, along with the stone Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple (Treasure No. 218), is a representative heritage of the early Gorye period.<br><br>In front of Wontongbojeon Hall (a hall enshrining Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva) stands a pagoda.

With no entrance as such, the cave is not open to the general public and thus its original form remains preserved to this day, giving it a high geological value. <Br><Br>
 
Although the Dangcheomuldonggul Cave is technically a lava tube, it resembles a limestone cave due to the secondary geological formations 
of lime substances that have accumulated in the ground above the tube. The tunnel has a spectacular and mystical beauty with countless stalactites and stalagmites, as well as stalactite columns. The particularly thin stalactites and stalactic columns in this cave are well-known for their uniqueness and beauty. Although this is a relatively small lava tunnel, its exotic colors and the richness of the secondary topological formations make it extraordinary in terms of research value. This cave has been designated natural monument.

It is also the only palace that sits alongside a series of Western style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery.  Deoksugung Palace originally belonged to Grand Prince Wolsan (1454-1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469-1494) of the Joseon dynasty.  It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not official change to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the “palace of virtuous longevity,” until 1907. While the palace incompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.<br><br>

Upon entering Deoksugung Palace through Daehanmun Gate, visitors will cross the wide bridge of Geumcheon Stream. The king's carriage would pass over this bridge during ancient times. The legal building Junghwajeon Hall is very stately, revealing its long history. Jeukjodang Building received its name from Gwanghaegun and In-Jo,  who both ascended to the throne here.  The nameplate on Jeukjodang was written personally by Gojong (26th king of the Joseon dynasty, r. 1863-1907) in 1905 after he became king. Hamnyeongjeon Hall was where Gojong slept, named with the meaning of wishing for lasting peace for Gojong.  The east wing served as the king’s room, and the west wing was for the queen.<br><br>

Jeonggwanheon Hall was the first Western-style building built in the palace, completed in 1900.  Gojong enjoyed drinking coffee and spending his free time here. The back of the building had secret passageways to the Russian Emissary, which still exist today. Seokjojeon Hall is the other Western-style building that still remains in Deoksugung Palace, and it was in the process of being built by a British man for his company, when in 1905 the property rights were transferred to Japan.  It was finally completed in 1910.  After Gojong’s death, Seokjojeon Hall became a Japanese art gallery open to the public. After the Korean Declaration of Independence, the American-Russian joint commission was held here as well in May 1946.  The east wing of Seokjogwan Hall now serves as a palace treasure exhibition, and the west wing is used as part of the  National Modern Art Center.<br><br>

 Junghwajeon Hall was the center of politics during the Korean Empire and served as the backdrop to critical discussions on national affairs among the country’s leaders. The elaborateness of the hall’s interior is said to reflect the confidence of King Gojong in his ability to effectively lead the country into the 20th century. One of the most striking parts of the building is the pair of dragons that decorates the canopy above the throne of the king. These dragons can also  be seen on the ceiling of Junghwajeon Hall and were representative designs of Deoksugung Palace, the imperial palace at that time. Though Junghwajeon Hall was originally built in 1902 as a multi-roofed  building, it was redesigned as a single-roofed building in 1906 after it caught on fire two years before that.|24|+82-2-771-9951|Deoksugung Palace (덕수궁)|04519|A02|A02|A0201|A02010100|

Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22 centimeters with a stride of approximately 90 centimeters, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus.

Heunginjimun Gate was the gate on the east side of the outer wall of Seoul Fortress among eight gates. It is referred to as Dongdaemun Gate as well. The gate was constructed during King Taejo’s 5th year in 1396, remodeled during the reign of King Danjong in 1453 and was newly built in 1869 during the sixth year of King Gojong’s reign in 1869. <br><br>

The gate features a hipped roof which has five front compartments and two side compartments on a two-storied building. The thin and weak bracket system supports the eaves and is excessively decorated, reflecting the construction features of the late Joseon period. Also, outside of the fortress is the half-circle shaped Ongseong, a small wall, to protect the gate.
<br><br>
One of the unique factors of Heunginjimun Gate is that it is the only gate among Seoul’s eight to have Ongseong, further exhibiting the style of construction used during the late Joseon period as well.|23|+82-2-2148-1842|Dongdaemun Gate (Heunginjimun Gate) (동대문 - 흥인지문)|03119|A02|A02|A0201|A02010300|

AD 826-836) and named it Donghwasa Temple, 
which means even during the winter season, the paulownia tree still blooms. The present temple was built in 1732. <Br>

When you turn the corner, the first thing that catches your eye is the Seolbeopjeon Hall. To the left of Seolbeopjeon is Daeungjeon Hall, the main building, and a path to the right leads to Geumgang Stairs.

Past Bongseoru are stairs that are typical of the ones leading into Daeungjeon, called "Nugak Stairs". On either side of the stairs are railings in the shape of a dragon, and in the middle of the stairs, there is a round stone marble that resembles a dragon orb, a ball often associated with dragons.  <br><Br>

These areas were visited many times by numerous scholars during the Joseon Period (1392-1910), and contain many historically and culturally important relics. There are Giamgwiseok on Mt. Sobaeksan, Mt. Geumsusan, and Mt. Doraksan and clear water flows through numerous falls in the valleys.  
<br>
<br>The most famous of the eight is Dodamsambong Peak. Three Rocks create a large “S” figure as it stands tall in the middle of Namhangang River. This is the only place in the world where you can see such three longest rocks protrude in the middle of a river.  The following legend still lives through to this day; among the three rocks, the big rock is called Nampyeonbong, Janggunbong the rock on the right side is called Cheobong (or Adeulbong), and the rock on the left is called Cheopbong (or Ddalbong). According to the legend there lived a couple who loved each other, but had no child.  They found a mistress because they wanted to have a baby, but once she had the baby, she began to mistreat and taunt the wife. The heavens saw them, and turned all of them into stones. The way the rocks stand next to one another is very interesting. 
<br>
<br>If you go to the opposite side of Dodamsambong, there is a small pavilion called lhoyangjeong. It was built to comfort the locals who lost their homes due to the flooding caused by Chungju Dam. When you look down from the pavilion, you can take in the entire Dodamsambong at once. If you walk in opposite direction from lhayangjeong Pavilion, a stone gate appears.  As there is a big hole in the middle of the large stone, you would think it is artificial, but it is a natural rock.  The other eight views should not be missed while you visit here.|2|No tel|Eight Scenic Views of Danyang (단양-팔경)|No zipcode|A01|A01|A0101|A01010300|

 The temple was founded by Monk Hyecheol and was given the name Haeansa Temple in the first year of King Heondeok’s reign during the Silla Kingdom (AD 809), but was moved to the current site in the Joseon dynasty in 1546 (the first year of King Myeongjong). Upon its relocation, King Injong of Joseon dynasty was commemorated with a new lecture hall along with a memorial stone plaque where the king's umbilical cord was buried and sealed. It was then when the temple was also given its current name, Eunhaesa Temple.<br>
 <br> The temple houses the main shrine, Bohwaru pavilion, Seolseondan Hall, Shimgeondang Hall, eight small hermitages, as well as Baegeungam Temple, Jungangam Temple, and a professional Buddhist education institution,&nbsp;the Eunhaesa Buddhist University.

The dinosaur footprints and other cretaceous fossils are located along the cape by the shore, so you must time your visit well to see them. According to paleontologists, the footprints are the evidence of three specimens of herbivorous: sauropoda, which walked on two 60 centimeter-long feet; two specimens of ornithopoda, which were also herbivores, that had three toes on each foot; and one specimen of another ornithopod species, a carnivore that had sharp claws and walked on two feet.

Basin is surrounded by high peaks and one of these peaks is Gachilbong. <br><br>The 
nature of the&nbsp;terrain in the Gachilbong area made it difficult to conduct 
military operations during the Korean War. The North Korean military utilized these natural features to build a solid defense position and launch counterattacks, while the 
South Korean soldiers in the lowland were in a disadvantageous position. South Korean soldiers were under the command of 5th 
Division Commander Brigadier General Min Gi-sik and 24th Regiment Commander 
Colonel Yu Ui-jun. On the North Korean side, the 7th, 14th, and 32nd Regiments of the 
27th Division and the 23rd Regiment of the 12th Division under the  2nd Corps fought back. <br><br>By 
sending a&nbsp;military deployment and conducting search operations, the 
South Korean military completed a reconnaissance of the area on August 30 and 
advanced to counterattack. On August 31, after defending their position for two 
days, the South Korean soldiers were able to break the North Korean resistance. 
Each unit secured a strongly fortified position to&nbsp;draw the North Korean 
soldiers out. Thereafter, South Korea launched an all-out attack and captured&nbsp;Hill

South Korea was able to take back Gachilbong and the surrounding areas. Although

Built in December, 1909 at the end of the Daehan Empire (1897-1910), it is an intricate building that houses a light tower (9.2 meters high), an office, and a lighthouse keeper’s room. Plum blossoms, the symbol of the imperial family of Joseon, are delicately carved along this European-style building. It is considered a remarkable cultural property not only because of its architectural design, unique shape or historic value, but also because it has been surprisingly well-maintained, especially in comparison to other lighthouses built during the same period. In recognition of its unmatched style and preservation, the old Gadeokdo lighthouse was designated Tangible Cultural Property No. 50 of Busan in Sep. 2003. It is owned and managed by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. A new lighthouse was built next to the original one in 2002. The new lighthouse structure is octagonal in shape and 40.5 meters high, the second highest lighthouse in Korea. <br><br>

Gadeokdo Island, the location of Gadeokdo lighthouse, is often referred to as the ‘Island of History,’ and is the largest island in Busan. Gadeokdo, a strategically important base for military operations and seaborne trade, was the stage for a number of gruesome battles during the Imjin War (1592-1598). Today, it is a critical entry point to the Jinhae Bay. <br><br>

Gadeokdo Lighthouse is located within a national naval base. Therefore, visitors must contact and register with the Busan Regional Maritime Affairs and Port Office prior to visiting the lighthouse. Those who participate in the Lighthouse Experience Program (parties of 6 or less) can spend the night in the innkeeper’s room free of charge. In order to use these accommodations, visitors must apply online at the Busan Regional Maritime Affairs and Port’s homepage between the 1st and the 8th of the month, one month prior to the desired date of visit.|1|No tel|Gadeokdo Lighthouse (가덕도 등대)|46771|A01|A01|A0101|A01011600|

The purpose of the temple site was to pray for help and guidance from Buddha against Japanese invasion. Unfortunately, King Munmu passed away before the completion of the temple, and left a will to be cremated and buried in the East Sea so that he may reincarnate as a sea dragon in order to protect the country. As he wished, King Munmu's ashes were scattered at Daewangam of the East Sea. The temple was completed and was named by his son, King Sinmun (AD 681-692) in respect and appreciation for his father. <br>

There are three remaining churches that were built in that time that were  influenced or built by the Western Christian Missionaries: Ganghwa Anglican Church established in 1900, Ganghwa St. Andrew's Church established in 1906, and Ganghwa Seodo Central Church established in 1923. <br><br>Ganghwa Seodo Central Church started contruction in February 1923 and was completed as a Korean-architecture chapel in July 1923. The original name was Jumun Church and it was renamed as Seodo Central (Jungang) Church in 1978. The church belongs to The Korean Methodist Church.<br><br>
Even though the building of the church doesn't reflect outstanding building techniques and aesthetic qualities, a Western church with a Korean-style wooden structure such as Ganghwa Seodo Central Church is still worth a visit.|1|+82-32-760-6474|Ganghwa Seodo Central Church (강화 서도 중앙교회)|23008|A02|A02|A0201|A02010900|

The site was designated as Historic Site No. 259 in 1977. Seonwonsa Temple was built by General Choi Wu in 1245 (the 32nd year of King Gojong’s reign during the Goryeo dynasty), which was right after the transfer of the capital to Ganghwado during resistance against the Mongolian invasion. <br><br>The temple was meant to be a spiritual mainstay in fighting against Mongolia. It used to be one of the two largest temples in Korea along with Songgwangsa Temple. However, the temple was completely destroyed during the early Joseon era, leaving only the site itself. The famous wood blocks of Palman Daejanggyeong (the Tripitaka Koreana), currently housed in Haeinsa Temple at Hapcheon, are said to have been originally stored in Seonwonsa Temple. It is believed that the carved wood blocks were taken from Seonwonsa to Heungcheonsa Temple during the Joseon era and again moved to Haeinsa Temple during the reign of Sejo. <br><br>Located on a mountain slope, the presumed location of the building site extends 250 meters from south to north and 170 meters from east to west.|1|+82-32-933-8234|Ganghwa Seonwonsa Temple Site (강화 선원사지)|23042|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

The inner castle was destroyed when the capital was moved to another place, and at the beginning of the Joseon Era (1392-1910) the wall was again rebuilt with mud. <br> <br>It went through much restoration until finally being rebuilt with stones. Ganghwasanseong Fortress originally had interior and exterior walls, but only the interior wall remains today.  It has an approximate circumference of 1.2km.  The exterior mud wall was approximately 9km in circumference with 8 gates.  The huge exterior wall was built along the side of the east channel of Ganghwa, but no longer exists today.  From 1977, the interior wall has been rebuilt many times over, but the east side of this wall has yet to be reconstructed.

Later, Preceptor Wonmyo rebuilt it in the old site during the reign of King Huijong (7th year) during the Goryeo period. He gained fame as Baengnyeongyeolsa so the temple began to be called Baengnyeonsa Temple. Baengnyeongyeolsa has produced eight preceptors of Goryeo and flourished throughout 120 years. In addition, the area is famous as the place where Dasan Jeong Yak-yong and Master Hyejang connected and developed companionship regardless of religious and age differences during Jeong was exiled to Gangjin. <br>
<br> The temple’s most popular attraction is Forest of Common Camellias, designated as Natural Monument No. 151.

In the forest, four stupas of Goryeo and Joseon Era are scattered like hide-and-seek. The forest features a tranquil ambience all year long even in daytime, thanks to the thick, green leaves. From November, the camellia flowers are in full bloom and the forest becomes red, beautiful enough to inspire visitors. After passing the forest on the way to Dasan Chodang, visitors can glimpse a colony of tea fields and wild tea produced by Baengnyeonsa Temple. The mountain where Baengnyeonsa Temple is situated has had wild tea fields grown from Goryeo Era so that it was called "Dasan."

is called the Geumgang River (Sea Diamond) of the South Sea.  As a rock island, Haegeumgang River 
belongs to Hallyeo Marine National Park, which is assigned as an official green area in South Korea.  Its original name was Galgotdo, because it is shaped like the spreading roots of arrowroot.  These days it is known as Haegeumgang 
River, meaning  Geumgangsan Mountain in the sea.
<br><br>
The most stunning scenery of Haegeumgang River is the sunset and sunrise and can be best viewed on Ilwollbong Peak or Lion Rock.  There is Shipjagul Cave in the center of Haegeumgang 
River, which is 100m long from east to west and 180m long from south to north. It has been called Shipjagul (meaning ‘cross’ in Korean) Cave because it looks like a cross when viewed from the sky.  If you go on the tour, you will be fascinated by the x_height of the rock walls and the inside of the cave.  A long time ago, scholars expressed their yearning for the beauty of nature by writing and reading poems they wrote on sailboats with a bowl of makkoli (rice wine) in their hands.
<br><br>
When you take a ship around the island, you’ll be fascinated once more because of the great works such as the Maitreya Rock, which reflects on Eunjin Maitreya, Candlestick Rock and the 1,300 year old guardian pine tree of Haegeumgang 
River.<br><br>|1|+82-55-639-4792|Geoje Haegeumgang Island (거제도 해금강)|53334|A01|A01|A0101|A01011300|

The name is said to have originated when the local islanders called the cone "Geomun," which is translated to “black,” referring to the dense forest formed on the crater. However, according to researchers and linguists, the term "Geomun" may have originated from a word from the Gojoseon period which were used to refer to deities, inferring that the name Geomun Oreum actually means "holy hill."

(Hangang River, Geumgang River, Nakdonggang River, Yeongsangang River). It starts from Jangsu-eup, North Jeolla-do. It flows northward and then changes direction in the vicinity of Greater Daejon and flows southwest through South Chungcheong-do before emptying into the Yellow Sea near Gunsan City. 
<br><br>
The total area of the Geumgang River Basin is 9,885 square kilometers with a length of 401 kilometers, making it the third longest in South Korea (right behind Hangang 
River and Nakdonggang River). The upstream of the river flows through the rugged mountains of <a href="http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264292"><font color="navy">Deogyusan</font></a> (1,594 meters; also the root of Geumgang River) and Baegunsan (1,279 meters) Mountains. 
<br><br>
The midstream and downstream areas feature basins and fertile alluvial plains, so they were one of the first settlements in Korea and the origin of the Baekje culture. The estuary in the downstream area is wide and deep due to the continuous sinking of the West shore, so it offers favorable conditions for a river port and an inland water conveyance system. 
<br><br>
Geumgang River has supplied water for the Honam (Jeolla-do) Field and served as Baekje Dynasty's main source of water, running through the capital city then.

It is one of the three tombs  that belong to the Noseo-dong Tombs&nbsp;in downtown Gyeongju.<br><br>
Geumgwanchong Tomb is regarded as the tomb of a king before or after the reign of King Ji-Jeung during the early 6th century (500~514). It is not known exactly to whom this tomb belongs.
<br>

<br>
It was found in September 1921, when the fief was chopped while a civilian was leveling the ground to widen his building land.  The first relic found in this tomb was a gold crown, <i>geumgwan</i>, and so 
the tomb took its name. Ornaments such as gold belts, earings, bracelets, saddlers and crockery of the Three Kingdoms Era (when Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla were separated, later unified by Silla in 676 AD) were dug up from the tomb.  There were numerous relics, with beaded relics alone numbering over 30,000.
<br>

<br>
The original structure of Geumgwanchong was 13m high with a 50m diameter.  The relics from this tomb were moved and are now

The mountain is also known as Minyeobong (beauty peak) because the mountain range is said to resemble a beautiful woman lying on her side when seen from afar. The mountain was originally called Baegamsan, but the noted Joseon-period scholar Yi Hwang (pen name, Toegye) renamed the mountain Geumsusan (silk embroidery mountain) when he was the chief governor of Danyang County, saying its graceful features matched the fineness of silk embroidery. <br><br>
Geumsusan Mountain is considered as one of the “Eight Scenic Views of Danyang” with visitors flocking all year round to enjoy the scenic mountain landscapes carpeted with royal azalea blossoms in spring, greenery in summer, foliage in autumn, and snow in

The observatory is shaped like an egg, in memory of the legend of King Kim Suro, the founder of the Garak Kingdom, according to which the king was born from an egg. <Br><br>
It is said that the queen of King Suro, Heo Hwang-ok, was a princess from the Indian country of Ayuta. Since sophisticated navigation equipment had yet to be invented, it can be assumed that she found her way to the Garak Kingdom by following the stars. It is also said that a prince of the Garak Kingdom built an observatory on the highest point of a mud fortress in Jinrye in order to make astronomical observations. The place is still referred to as Bibidan, which means a place to watch the stars. <Br><br>
These historical facts indicate the stars were very important to the Gaya, an ancient kingdom established mainly in the Gimhae area.

The peak was originally named Gusubong (“gu” meaning “turtle,” “su” meaning “head”) after its resemblance to the head of a turtle. The flat part of the peak (the turtle’s “head”) is home to the Tomb of King Suro. On the summit is a southern-style dolmen dating back to the 4th century BC that consists of 5 or 6 support stones and a large cover stone measuring 2.5m in diameter. The cover stone bears the inscription “Gujibongseok,” said to be written by Han Ho. <br><br>

Gujibong Peak is considered a sacred place by the local people because, according to legend, it is the place where the creation of the Gaya Kingdom took place.

According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (AD 330) of the Silla Kingdom. However, this region belonged to the Baekje kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (AD 330) of the Baekje kingdom. Historians agree, however, that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in AD 790 and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in AD 1143. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  <br><br>

Only about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today. Moreover, the original embankment underwent major transformations in 1925 when the Dongjin Land Improvement Association remolded it into a channel for carrying water to nearby fields. <br><br>In 1975, an archeological study of the sites where the two floodgates once stood revealed that highly refined measuring techniques had been used in the original construction of the reservoir. Thus, despite its many changes, Byeokgolje not only holds significance as Korea’s oldest manmade reservoir, but also as a historical relic that points to the highly developed engineering technology of the past.|3|+82-63-540-4094|Gimje Byeokgolje Reservoir (김제 벽골제)|54425|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

Gimnyeong Maze Park contains a maze that has various images incorporated in it. The maze is in the shape of the Jeju Island, and its images that can be clearly seen from above include the following: a serpent, which was an object of worship on the island until the mid-70s; horses of Jeju Island, which were brought there by Mongolians as far back as 1276; the ship, Sparrowhawk, that was shipwrecked on the island in 1653 bringing Hendrick Hamel and his company of Dutch sailors to the Joseon Kingdom; and dolmens that are relics from the Bronze Age.  All of these images are famous symbols or landmarks of Jeju Island.<Br><Br>

The temple was built in the Silla Era and, with 16 buildings, is the second largest temple after Bulguksa. <br><br>
Legend has it that the temple was originally built by the Venerable Gwang-yu, a sage from India, in the early part of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was reportedly called Imjeongsa at first, but was later changed to Girimsa after undergoing expansive renovations by Monk Wonhyo. It is still unclear exactly what year the temple was built in.   

<br><br>Girimsa is divided into two main areas. The first is the area around Daejeokgwangjeon Hall where the statue of Birojanabul is enshrined. The second is the area around the majestic 500-year-old bo tree (a kind of large fig tree) that is home to a wooden pagoda, the Seongbo Museum, Samsingak, Mangbujeon, and Gwaneumjeon halls. Daejeokgwangjeon Hall was first built during Queen Seondeok's reign, and was rebuilt six times since its original construction. Its simple but majestic architecture is characterized by baeheullim (aka, entasis columns) and a Dapoyangsik (Dapo-style) single-tiered gabled roof. 
<br>
<br>Girimsa is famous for Ojongsu, water that is said to have five different tastes. It consists of gamrosu, which is best for making tea; hwajeongsu, which supposedly gives comfort to the drinker; janggunsu, which makes the body stronger; myeongansu, which gives clear vision; and otaksu, which is said to sparkle so brightly that it attracts all the birds of the air. During Japanese colonial rule, the source of janggunsu, literally meaning ‘water of a general,’ was reportedly blocked off by Japanese soldiers, who were afraid the water would give the Korean people the strength to overthrow them. Except for janggunsu, water still continues to flow from each source. <br>

On the way to Girimsa temple is Golgulsa Temple, well known for its 12 grottos. Golgulsa was originally a hermitage of Girimsa. After becoming an independent institution, it became the center of Seonmudo practice in Korea. The temple aims to promote the art of seonmudo on a national and international level.|2|+82-54-744-2292|Girimsa Temple (기림사)|38120|A02|A02|A0201|A02010800|

meters) is located next to Sintalli Station, which is the railroad disconnection 
point of the Gyeongwon Line. It is also on the way to Geumgangsan Mountain. 
Godaesan is ideal for mountain hiking because of its  natural beauty and well-preserved 
ecosystem. Moreover, this is the only mountain in South Korea on which the North Korean territory can be seen. 
<br><br>There are several theories about the origin of the mountain's name. 
One is that the mountain had been referred to as "keungore" (big 
whale) in the past by local residents. Another is that the mountain looks like&nbsp;the 
banggorae (smoke duct) of a Korean traditional heating system when seen from 
the Sintan area; this is because the mountain's deep valleys resemble the furrows 
under that house that facilitate the passage of hot air to heat the room above. 


On a topographic map, the mountain was also marked as "Gotae" (like 
the constellations high above). <br><br>Godaesan also has a dense forest, making 
it a suitable source of timber and charcoal. Because of its abundant forest 
resources, a  jumak (a tavern or inn that served food and liquor and 
provided lodging to travelers) village was formed here. The place was well-known for 
charcoal production prior to the Korean War.
<br><br>
On November 4, 1907, 150 soldiers from the&nbsp;Korean militia fought a fierce battle with the 8th Company of the Japanese 
Army's 20th  Infantry Regiment in Yeoncheon. After the  fight, the Korean militia 
were scattered throughout  the jumak village. Later on, 60 of them engaged in a 
fierce battle again with 
the Japanese soldiers on Godaesan. This is a place imbued with the brave spirit of the Korean people.|21|+82-31-834-3064|Godaesan Mountain (고대산)|11001|A01|A01|A0101|A01010400|

He is known to be the grandson of the heavens and the son of Hwanung. According to the legend, Hwanung was approached by a bear and a tiger who wished to become human beings. Hwanung attended to their plea by instructing them to avoid sunlight for 100 days and live only by consuming garlic and mugwort. Unlike the tiger who gave up, the bear followed the instructions faithfully and transformed into a woman, who then married Hwanung and gave birth to Dangun.<br>

An annual ancestral rite takes place at the shrine on October 3 (National Foundation Day) and March 15 to pay respects to Dangun. Dangunjeon Shrine was also a place where civilians gathered to take an oath of patriotism in action against the Japanese during Japanse colonization period; a stone plaque commemorating the March 1st Independence Movement and Baekdang Memorial Hall dedicated to Shin Tae-yun can also be found within the area.

The castle is about 2.5km long, and there are two ways of touring the castle. One way is to start from the parking lot, pass the west gate, Geumseoru, and walk along the cement road. The other way is to turn left at the beginning of the cement road and walk along the top of the castle, which is called Sanseong Road. The cement road is very smooth and you can walk along it comfortably.

Tomb of King Muryeong was found to be unusual in the way it was built and what it contained. It was built with bricks like the 6th Tomb, and many national treasures were found inside, supplying scholars studying Baekje culture with precious research material. There were 108 kinds of artifacts found inside, totaling 2,906 items altogether. Twelve of these artifacts were designated National Treasures. They are all on display at Gongju National Museum. Some of the representative treasures are the crowns worn by the king and the queen, gold decorations for the crowns, gold earrings, necklaces, bronze mirrors, pillows, and foot rests. Recently the tomb was permanently sealed off to protect the treasures.

In the 19th year of his reign, King Gojong moved the capital to Ganghwa on account of its natural and strategic advantages. 
During the Byeongjahoran (Chinese invasion of Korea) in 1637, the palace was lost by force to the Qing dynasty of China. Later, Joseon Dynasty palace building and Ganghwa Yusubu (Ganghwa governor’s office) buildings existed in the Goryeo palace site but were destroyed by the French army during the Byeonginyangyo (French Campaign against Korea). Nowadays, the only structures that remain are the Dongheon main office (built in 1638) and Ibangcheong administration office (built in 1654).

Around the first century, Daegaya was formed in the Nakdonggang River’s downstream area in the lower Korean peninsula, flourished independently for 520 years (AD 42~562), and declined after the 6th century.  After its decline, part of it was annexed by Silla (57 BC ~ AD 935), and the rest annexed by Baekjae (18 BC~AD 60), and became a forgotten tribal kingdom. 
<br>
On King Jinheung’s (reign 540~576) 23rd year of reign it became the district of Daegaya, and the name was changed to the district of Goryeong on King Gyeongdeok’s (reign 742~765) 16th year of reign.

Goseokjeong Pavilion is a two-story tower-style pavilion that has an area of about 33 square meters, built halfway up the Hantangang River during the reign of King Jinpyeong (reign 579-632 AD) of the Silla Kingdom. Today, Goseokjeong refers to the entire area around Goseokjeong Pavilion and the valley surrounding Goseok Rock. Designated as Monument No. 8 of Gangwon-do, the pavilion is known to have been one of the most favored places by King Jinpyeong of Silla Kingdom, and King Chungsuk of Goryeo dynasty. The area became all the more famous as the arena of Im Kkeok-jeong (?-1562), who was a legendary leader of a peasant rebellion in the early Joseon dynasty. <br><br>

The pavilion was destroyed during the Korean War and restored in 1971 by community leaders in Cheorwon. Unfortunately, it was damaged once again by flood in 1996 and reconstructed the year after. There is a natural stone chamber inside Goseokbawi Rock that Im Kkeok-jeong used as a hiding place. On the opposite side, there are remains of a stone castle.

Muju Gucheondonggyegok Valley is not a deep valley. However, the valley flows through a lush forest that's quite beautiful. The calm and soothing sounds of the river are very refreshing.  
<br>
<br>The 33 scenic points of Gucheondonggyegok Valley are what make it so famous.  Of the 33, the most famous are Najetongmun and Sushimdae.  Najetongmun, the first scenic point is a huge boulder with a hole through it like a tunnel.  During the Samguk era, this spot once served as the border between the Silla and Baekje nations.  Because it was the dividing line between the two nations, even to this day, the east and west side's speech and customs are different.  No one knows how the hole got there, but the experience of walking through it is quite interesting. Sushimdae, the 12th scenic point, is a valley approximately 400 m in length.  It is surrounded by mountain cliffs, which makes the area resemble Geumgangsan Mountain, therefore it is often referred to as Sogeumgangsan Mountain, or little Geumgangsan Mountain.  The clear water and beautiful scenery makes this spot a must-see.

 Cheoneunsa Temple is believed to have been built by Monk Deokun from India in AD 828 during the 3rd year of King Heungdeok. Because it initially laid next to spring water as clean and cold as a morning dew, the temple was also called Gamrosa, meaning Sweet Dew Temple.

 The temple was later renamed Cheoneunsa. Legend has it that while the temple was being rebuilt after the Japanese Invasion (1592-1598), somebody killed a large serpent appearing out of nowhere, which lead to&nbsp;sudden drying up of the spring water. Hence, the name Cheoneunsa, meaning Disappearance of Spring Water, was given.<br>

According to legendary myth, a sudden massive thunderstorm took nine dragons to heaven. That is where Guryongpo (meaning Nine Dragons) Beach got its name. <br><br>

What makes this destination so special is its climate and geographical location. Featuring a hilly terrain, warm winter and cool summer weather, and a long shoreline extending to about 15.8 kilometers, Guryongpo Beach is an ideal getaway. The Guryeongpo seaport is well developed because of its inshore fishery, as it is the heart of the major fishing industry within the district. Here one can find cuttlefish, mackerel pikes, mother crabs, and other delicacies that are caught and shipped to the markets. With the fish boats and buoys gently swaying in the background,  and seagulls gliding peacefully overhead, Guryeong-po beach is an ideal location to watch the beautiful sunrise during the winter months.<br><br>

Guryeongpo beach, which is favored by many tourists not only for its beauty but also for being the perfect summer getaway, is only about 24 kilometers away from the city of Pohang and 1.5 kilometers from the town of Guryeongpo. The half-moon shaped shoreline, with a length of about 400 meters and a x_width of over 50 meters, is favored most amongst campers who find the place a perfect summer getaway.|23|+82-54-275-9405|Guryongpo Beach (구룡포해수욕장)|37931|A01|A01|A0101|A01011200|

Because of its outstanding beauty, Governor Jeong In-ji gave the garden the name ‘Gwanghallu’ in 1444, comparing it to a garden from the palace on the moon. It is famous as the location where Lee Mong-ryong and Chunhyang (two lovers from a well-known Korean folk story) first met. In the 1920’s Chunhyangsa Temple was established in the neighboring area and a portrait of Chunhyang was hung in a place of honor. The garden is the venue of the Chunhyangjae Festival every spring, celebrating the deep and lasting love of the famous couple.

It was often referred to as Sugumun Gate (water channel gate) and was actually used as a Sigumun, literally meaning “corpse gate”, as funeral processions passed through this gate when exiting to the east.  
<br><br>
During the Imjin War (1592-1598), the fortress gate was destroyed to such a degree that it made finding the original location close to impossible.  Nevertheless, reconstruction efforts were started in 1711 (37th year of King Sukjong) and the water channel gate was restored and a gate tower built. Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was damaged during the Korean War and left neglected. In 1975, restoration work was carried out to relocate Gwanghuimun Gate to a site 15 meters south of its original location since it stood in the middle of the road.|24|No tel|Gwanghuimun Gate (광희문)|04614|A02|A02|A0201|A02010300|

It is also the main gate of the palace, therefore larger and fancier in comparison to the other gates. Gwanghwamun Gate consists of three arched gates; the center gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by the crown prince and royal officials. The tall granite walls of the gate serve as a platform for the wooden gate tower that watches over the city. The gate has a sign with its name written at the top center of the gate tower. <br>
<br> Gwanghwamun Gate went through several damages and restorations over the course of history. It was first severely damaged during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and was not restored until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1864. Under the Japanese administration, the gate was demolished and relocated to the north of the palace's eastern gate, followed by series of damages during the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1968, Gwanghwamun Gate was relocated back to the south of the palace and was rebuilt using concrete; however, the gate’s position was shifted a few meters away from its original location. In 2006, a major reconstruction project took place to restore Gwanghwamun Gate to its original state and location, disassembling the structure completely and replacing concrete with granite and wood. After three years and eight months of construction, Gwanghwamun Gate was fully restored to its original form and was open to the public on August 15, 2010.|23|+82-2-3700-3900|Gwanghwamun Gate (광화문)|03045|A02|A02|A0201|A02010300|

 fleet with 1,230 American naval forces led by Rear Admiral John Rodgers landed on Ganghwado Island to demand the 
opening of Korea's ports and commerce. The armed forces attacked Chojijin Fortress 
and Deokjinjin Camp, then marched to Gwangseongbo Fortress, where they engaged in close combat with the warriors of Joseon. Although General Eo Jae-yeon and the other warriors were poorly equipped with far inferior weapons, they bravely fought to the 
death against the invading forces.

The temple is widely believed to have been established by the great monk Uisang Daesa during the 16th year of King Munmu (676). However, some experts site the existence of the Namgeunseok stone animal sculpture as proof that the temple was originally the private temple of King Beop of the Baekje Kingdom. <br><br>

Throughout history, the temple has had many names—Guksinsa, Gwisinsa, Gusunsa, and Gwisinsa (same English spelling, different meaning)—but not much is known about when the temple was called by which name. On the temple grounds are a 3-story stone pagoda and some stone sculptures including seoksu (animal statues) and budo (a stupa in honor of a great master). Inside the temple are Daejeokgwangjeon Hall (Treasure No.826), Myeongbujeon Hall, and Gongyangjib Chamber (a chamber for Buddhist offerings).|3|+82-63-548-0917|Gwisinsa Temple - Gimje (귀신사 - 김제)|54343|A02|A02|A0201|A02010800|

On the west side of Gyebangsan Mountain is Unduryeong Pass(1,089 m), which has a vehicle accessible road. Asiatic black beers are said to habitate in the deep valleys on the north side, and there is Bangadari mineral water and other mineral water sources on the south side. With many varieties of herbs and wild flowers growing naturally in the area, it is also well known as a place to dig for wild ginseng. Its rare Japanese yew trees and royal azalea combined with its similar terrain to Seoraksan Mountain's Daecheongbong Peak has caused the mountain to be a highly protected ecological environment.<br><br>

Gyebangsan Mountain is particularly popular for winter hikers, who can get beautiful views of the snowy landscapes of the mountain even&nbsp;until March. On top of that, since the difference in evelation from Unduryeong to the top of Gyebangsan is only 488 m, it welcomes even novice hikers as well. From the summit, one can see the backboone of Baekdudaegan Mountain, and with its panoramic views of Seoraksan Mountain to the north, Odaesan Mountain and Daegwallyeong to the east, and Taegisan and Hoegisan Mountains to the west, it is one of the best views in the area.|15|+82-33-332-6419|Gyebangsan Mountain (계방산 (평창))|25312|A01|A01|A0101|A01010400|

Situated on the west side of Seoul, it was also called Seogwol, meaning "a palace of the west."  The secondary palace was where the king moved to in times of emergency.  
<br><br>
From In-Jo to Cheol-Jong, about ten kings from the Joseon Dynasty stayed here at Gyeonghuigung. This palace was built using the slanted geography of the surrounding mountain, and it boasts traditional beauty in its architecture and huge historical significance. For a time, it was of a considerable size, even to the point of having an arched bridge connecting it to Deoksugung Palace. For the king’s royal audience, there was Sungjeongjeon and Jajeongjeon buildings, and for sleeping quarters, Yungbokjeon and Hoesangjeon buildings.  
<br>

<br>
Altogether there were about 100 small and large buildings on the palace grounds. But when Japan began occupation of Korea in 1908, the Japanese school, Gyeongseong Middle School moved into the palace, and as a result, much of the palace became leveled or moved.  Currently, Gyeonghuigung’s front gate, Heunghwamun, is being used as the front gate for Shilla Hotel’s main entrance, and Sungjeongjeon is at Dongguk University. The school moved out to a different area, and the Sungjeongjeon and some of the other buildings have been reconstructed.

In the 1980s, a pottery fragment with letters “Wolji” (a pond that reflects the moon) carved onto it was found, revealing the true name of the pond. After the discovery, the site was renamed to the current Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond.|2|+82-54-750-8655|Gyeongju Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond (경주 동궁과 월지)|38163|A02|A02|A0201|A02010700|

The forest is thickly populated by ancient zelkova and willow trees rooted on gently sloping hills and along the small stream in the northwest part of the woods. According to legend, the forest is closely associated with myths surrounding the birth of Alji, the founder of the Gyeongju Kim clan. As such, it is designated national Historic Site No. 19. <br>

Legend has it that King Talhae heard a rooster crying from deep inside the Sirim Woods. Chancellor Hogong was sent to investigate. Upon arriving, he found a rooster crying underneath a tree on which hung a golden box. Hogong immediately reported his find to the king, who instructed him to bring the golden box into the palace. The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‘Sirim’ or ‘Gurim’, became known as ‘Gyerim’, ('gye’ meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. 

<br>Alji was adopted as the king’s son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne. The Kim clan later became the royal bloodline with the coronation of King Naemul some years later. <br>
 
The memorial stone recording the birth of Kim Alji was erected in the third year of King Sunjo's rule in the Joseon Dynasty. Located close to the royal fortress of Silla, the forest is still deeply revered as the mystical birthplace of the first ancestor of the royal Kim clan of Silla. Yellow canola blossoms along the path connecting Daereungwon with Gyerim and Banwolseong only add to the magical ambiance of the forest.

<br>
The Gyeongju Historic Area can be divided into 5 major sections. The first section is the Namsan Area, a treasure trove of Buddhist art masterpieces dating back to the Silla Kingdom. Gyeongju Namsan Mountain (often referred to as an ‘outdoor museum’) is home to many historical heritage sites from the Silla Kingdom. Major attractions include: Poseokjeong (Historic Site No.1), Tapgok Maaejosanggun (Treasure No. 201), Cheollyongsaji Three-story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1188), Chilbulam Maae Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 200), Bulgok Seated Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 198), and 37 other Buddhist relics<br>
<br>
The second section is the Wolseong Area, one of the former palace sites of the Silla Kingdom. The area consists of Gyerim (Historic Site No. 19); Donggung Palace and Wolji (Historic Site No. 18), a Silla Royal Palace site; and Cheomseongdae (National Treasure No. 31), the oldest observatory in the East. Daereungwon area, the third area, features a cluster of the royal graves of the Kings and Queens of Silla. <br>
<br>
Also in the same area are Gobungun (a cluster of old graves) in Nodong-ri (Historic Site No. 38), Gobungun (a cluster of old graves) in Noseo-ri (Historic Site No. 39) Gobungun (a cluster of old graves) in Hwangnam-ri (Historic Site No. 40), and Oreung (Historic Site No. 172), among others. Archaeologists have discovered a number of invaluable relics and historic items in this area such as Geumgwan (golden crown), Cheonmado (a painting of flying horses), and numerous pottery pieces. These finds are perhaps the greatest clues into the life of the people of the Silla Dynasty.<br>
<br>
Area number four, the Hwangnyongsa Area, is where the former site of the Hwangnyongsa Temple (Historic Site No. 246) and Bunhwangsa Stone Pagoda are located. Lastly, is the Sanseong Area, housing remnants of the major defense system for the capital city. The site consists of Myeonghwalsanseong Fortress (Historic Site No. 47) which is estimated to be around 400 years old.<br>

During the Silla Era, the Hwangnyongsa Temple was the nation’s largest temple and housed the bulk of the country’s major Buddhist treasures. <br>
 <br>
 Construction of the temple began in 553 on a field near the royal compound of Banwolseong under the commission of King Jinheung. The king originally planned to build a palace, but decided to build a temple instead, after receiving reports that a yellow dragon had been spotted on the building site. The temple was thus named Hwangnyongsa (Temple of Yellow Dragon) and was completed in 569, seventeen years after construction began. The temple murals feature an old pine tree drawn by Artist Solgeo. During the Silla Era, the temple was the center of state-sanctioned Buddhism. <br>
 <br>
 Later, when monk Jajang was studying in Tang, he came across a god as he was passing by the Taihe Pond. The god said to him, “The yellow dragon, which is my eldest son, is guarding Hwangnyongsa Temple upon orders of Brahma, the Creator. If you build a nine-story pagoda upon your return to Silla, the neighboring states will surrender and pay tribute, and the royal cause will be stronger. Once the construction of the pagoda is complete, prepare a memorial service for the local gods and pardon any of the country's criminals. If you follow all I have told you, no other state will dare invade Silla.” <br>
<br>
 After this encounter, Jajang returned to Silla and convinced Queen Seondeok to build the nine-story pagoda. Master architect Abiji of the neighboring state Baekje designed the pagoda and the project was built by Yongchun and his 200 men using wood and stone. The night before the columns were to be erected, Architect Abiji of Baekje dreamed of the fall of Baekje and refused to complete the project. With a peal of thunder, an old monk and a man of great strength suddenly appeared from the temple's main hall, erected the columns, and magically disappeared. Abiji was so shocked at the sight that he accepted his country’s future demise as the fate of the gods and once again restarted work on the temple. (From Samgungnyusa, the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) <br>
 <br>
 In the twenty-three years following the completion of the pagoda, Queen Seondeok unified the Three Kingdoms; later, numerous scholars pointed to the pagoda as a contributing factor in the unification. Of the three treasures of Silla (the Jangyukjonsang statue, the nine-story pagoda of Hwangnyongsa Temple, and the Heavenly Belt of King Jinpyeong) two were located at the Hwangnyongsa Temple. The largest bell of Silla was also in Hwangnyongsa, but was taken away during the Mongol invasion. The highest monks of Silla preached at the temple, and many kings came to listen to the Buddhist teachings. <br>
<br>
 During excavation work in July 1969, the massive foundation stones of the sermon hall, auditorium, and pagoda were found. Eight years of archaeological excavations and studies revealed the unique layout of the temple grounds, which consisted of one pagoda and three halls; also found were 40,000 or so ancient artifacts. Though foundation stones and other structures from the bottom of the temple were identified through excavation, there are no historical clues about the temple’s upper design, making the restoration of the temple in its entirety practically impossible. The size of the temple, based on archeological findings, was about 70 acres, roughly&nbsp;eight times&nbsp;larger than&nbsp;that of the Bulguksa Temple.|2|+82-54-779-6100|Gyeongju Hwangnyongsaji (Hwangnyongsa Temple Site) (경주 황룡사지)|38162|A02|A02|A0201|A02010900|

According to Samguksagi (Historical records of the Three Kingdoms) and Samgungnyusa (Memorabilia from the three dynasties), Park Hyeokgeose, the founding monarch of Silla, was born by this well. In 69 BC, Sobeolgong, the head of Goheochon Village, saw a white horse on its knees by the well. When he approached the well he found that the horse had magically disappeared and that a large egg was left in its place, from which a boy was born. When the boy turned 13 years old (57 BC), he was appointed king by the village chiefs and began to rule the area then called ‘Seorabeol’.

This mountain boasts nearly 40 valleys winding down from Geumobong Peak (468 m in elevation), Gowibong Peak (494 m in elevation), and other surrounding peaks. Also, this 4 km-wide and 8km-long oval-shaped mountain runs almost perfectly north to south. 
<br><br>
Namsan Mountain is a veritable open-air museum, with 100 temples, 80 stone Buddha statues, and 60 stone pagodas scattered across the mountainside. Topographically, it features nearly 40 valleys and is divided into the Southwest Mountain, a sacred place during the Silla period, and the Southeast Mountain, where many Buddhas can be found around the valleys. 
<br><br>
Najeong Well, at the western foot of Namsan Mountain, is the mythic birthplace of King Park Hyeokgeose, founder of the Silla Kingdom. The local Yangsanjae Shrine was built in honor of its founder who lived in Seorabeol before the Silla Kingdom was established. Poseokjeong Pavilion is the place where the glorious era of the Silla Kingdom came to an end. In the Southeast Mountain region, one can encounter the Seated Buddha of Borisa Temple, a 9-meter Bulmusa Stone Buddha Statue, and a Seated Stone Buddha at Gamsil Shrine. <br><br>Namsan Mountain also features 12 treasures, including Mireukgol Seated Stone Buddha, a three-storey stone pagoda in Yongsangsa Temple, the Maae Stone Buddha in Chilbulam Temple, and others.

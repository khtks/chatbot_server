Darakjeong has been popular for a long time because of the simple taste of its traditional Mandu (Korean stuffed dumpling). Since its opening in 1991, tasty soup and scrumptious Mandu have been served. A fist-sized Mandu is fully packed with seasoned meat, bean-curd, and various vegetables. Its thick dough makes it chewy and delightful. For one person, “Manduguk”(boiled dumpling soup) is a good choice. The delicious and nourishing taste of Mandu goes well with the sweet, spicy, and fresh taste of the soup. Manduguk is served in a brass bowl which keeps the food warm while eating. For a large-size group, “Mandujeongol” cooked with various vegetables in a casserole is recommended. There are two types of Mandujeongol that have different tastes. The main characteristic of “Kimchi Mandujeongol” is its spicy flavor, which reminds people of the refreshing taste of Kimchi soup, and “Tojang Mandujeongol” expounds on the savory taste of bean-paste soup. Tojang means folk soybean-paste. “Nokdujeon”(a Korean pan-fried dish with green mung bean) is another famous dish at Darakjeong, which is pan-fried with a very light seasoning to emphasize the original taste of Nokdu (green mung bean). Salted oysters with hot pepper are served with Nokdujeon instead of soy sauce, which is a perfect match.

Not a dog owner? No problem! Sunnyne Pet Café is a great place to spend time with these wonderful animals, regardless of whether or not you have your own dog.

In place of an entrance fee, each visitor is asked to order an item from the menu.
